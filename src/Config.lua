local M = {}

M.MOD_ID = "rby_mmo"

-- Bumped when a wire change is not backward compatible.  The hub refuses a
-- client whose PROTOCOL differs, with a message naming both versions --
-- silently talking a different dialect is the worst failure mode here.
--
-- 3 added parties.  Nothing was removed, so an older client's messages would
-- all still parse -- but the failure that mattered is the other direction:
-- against a protocol-2 hub, an invite and a party chat line are message
-- types and a scope that hub has never heard of, and its handler table
-- answers an unknown type with silence.  The player would press INVITE and
-- watch nothing happen, forever, with nothing on screen to act on.  A
-- refusal that names both versions is the better sentence, so the number
-- moved.
--
-- 4 adds ranked PVP, and moved for the same reason rather than a different
-- one: a protocol-3 hub has never heard of a battle result or a leaderboard
-- request, so a newer client would report every match into silence and open
-- a RANK screen that never fills.  This number lives here and in
-- server/lib/relay.js -- bump them together.
--
-- 5 was claimed twice, by two branches that had never met: once for pace
-- (the `fast` flag on mmo.move -- "this step was taken at the fast pace",
-- set by a sprint *or* the bike, since both cost 8 frames a tile) and once
-- for co-op battles (a protocol-4 hub has never heard of mmo.coop_wait: a
-- player would press WAIT FOR <friend> and stand there while their partner
-- is never told).  Each 5 was a different vocabulary, so a client and hub
-- that both said "5" could still be talking past each other -- exactly the
-- silence this number exists to turn into a sentence.  6 is the first
-- number that means both.
--
-- And then 6 was claimed twice in exactly the same way, before it ever
-- shipped: once by that union, and once for changing character in the
-- middle of a game (mmo.sprite -- a hub that has never heard the type
-- answers it with silence, so the player who picked somebody new would be
-- the only person in the game who could see it).  7 is the first number
-- that means all of it.
--
-- 8 is mmo.party_event -- what the person you are travelling with just did,
-- fanned out by the hub to the party and to nobody else.  The rule that moved
-- every number above moves this one: a protocol-7 hub has never heard the
-- type, so its handler table answers it with silence, and a player would
-- watch their partner fight all evening and never be told a thing.  Neither
-- end could tell that from an ordinary quiet route, which is exactly the
-- silence this number exists to turn into a sentence.  This number lives here
-- and in server/lib/relay.js -- bump them together.
--
-- 9 is mmo.request_cancel -- the asker withdrawing a trade/battle request
-- before it is answered.  A protocol-8 hub has never heard the type, so
-- cancelling would clear the asker's local wait while the hub still held
-- pendingTo: the other player could still accept and pull them into a
-- session they thought they had walked away from.  Silence is worse than a
-- refusal that names both versions, so the number moved.
--
-- 10 is the mediated battle: the seven mmo.battle_* types in src/Wire.lua,
-- through which an intermediator -- the dedicated hub, or a LAN host -- owns
-- every roll in an MMO fight instead of one of the players' clients.  A
-- protocol-9 hub relays and never simulates, so it has never heard any of the
-- seven and its handler table answers each with silence.  The failure that
-- silence buys is worse than any of the ones above it: the two players agree
-- to fight, each uploads a party into nothing, and then both stand in front of
-- a battle that never starts, waiting on a mmo.battle_ready no process on the
-- other end is going to send -- and there is no local fallback left to catch
-- them, because the mediated path is a hard cut and the old lockstep handoff
-- is gone.  A refusal naming both versions is the only sentence either player
-- can act on.  This number lives here and in server/lib/relay.js -- bump them
-- together.
--
-- 11 is the mediated battle event `chose` -- a seat filed this turn's answer,
-- so peers can keep the wait line accurate without an `act` fan-out -- and
-- `unchose`, which clears that mark when a player cancels a choice they already
-- submitted.  From PROTOCOL 12, `moves` syncs the live move list after Transform
-- or Mimic.  A protocol-10 intermediator never emits either kind, so a newer
-- client's wait line would name players who have already answered, or keep
-- naming players who walked their answer back, and neither failure looks like
-- lag -- both read as "still choosing".  A refusal naming both versions is the
-- only sentence either player can act on.  This number lives here and in
-- server/lib/relay.js -- bump them together.
--
-- 13 extends `mmo.battle_ruleset` with optional `specialTypes` (Gen1 phys/spec
-- by type index) and `metronomePool` (ephemeral move sheets for Metronome).
-- A protocol-12 intermediator strips both, so Special damage stays atk/def and
-- Metronome keeps saying "But nothing happened".  Refusal naming both versions
-- is the only sentence either player can act on.
--
-- 14 is the mediated FIGHT/ITEM/SWITCH/RUN surface, item targeting, `mode=wild`,
-- and catch outcomes. 15 adds an optional battle `bag` on `mmo.battle_party`
-- so the hub can refuse / debit item choices against the uploaded sheet.
-- Absent bag means empty: a protocol-14 client that never uploads one cannot
-- spend items on a 15 hub. Refusal naming both versions is the only sentence
-- either player can act on.
--
-- 17 is friends -- mmo.friend_ask, mmo.friend_answer and mmo.friend_remove.
-- Those types landed as PROTOCOL 10 on the parallel main line while this
-- branch claimed 10–16 for mediation and persistent playerId; a protocol-16
-- intermediator answers all three with silence, and this is the one feature
-- whose answer may legitimately arrive *later* -- the hub holds an ask for a
-- player who is offline -- so "nothing yet" is an ordinary state, and a player
-- would have no way at all to tell it apart from a hub that cannot do this.
--
-- 18 is Party vs Wild: mode token `coop_wild` (two humans vs one wild NPC seat)
-- and an optional `catcher` player id on `mmo.battle_outcome` so a successful
-- ball names who keeps the mon. A protocol-17 hub's closed BATTLE_MODES set
-- drops `coop_wild` opens, and its outcome cleaner strips an unknown `catcher`
-- field -- either way the partner never joins the grass fight, or both clients
-- grant (or neither does) because ownership was never named. Refusal that
-- names both versions is the only sentence either player can act on.
--
-- 19 adds host-owned co-op gameplay policy to WELCOME and to the shared battle
-- field. A protocol-18 client would ignore a host disabling rewards and pay
-- them anyway, so this is a semantic incompatibility rather than an optional
-- display field. This number lives here and in server/lib/relay.js -- bump them
-- together.
--
-- 20 makes Party vs Wild a live, joinable mediated encounter. The initiator
-- begins before a second player accepts; the hub retains the packed field and
-- authoritative event history, and a late entrant is hydrated before joining
-- live fan-out. A protocol-19 client would interpret COOP_JOINED as the old
-- fixed-roster start and wait forever for the second party, so refusal is the
-- only safe mixed-version behavior.
--
-- 21 adds the optional Campaign State authority vocabulary. A protocol-20 hub
-- would silently ignore a shared world's frontier advertisement and sequence
-- requests, leaving the campaign replica unable to commit. The combined
-- integration therefore gets its own generation; the standalone flexible-
-- Wild branch remains protocol 20.

-- How often presence is pushed while moving.  The overworld steps on a

-- without turning every step into four packets.
M.PRESENCE_INTERVAL = 0.125

-- A remote avatar more than this many tiles from where the network says it
-- should be has lost the thread (packet loss, a warp we never saw, a long
-- stall).  Walking it back one tile at a time would take longer than the
-- drift lasts, so it is despawned and respawned at the true cell instead.
M.RESYNC_DISTANCE = 6

-- How far an avatar is pushed up the draw order so the local player always
-- wins a shared tile.  The overworld sorts entities by their pixel `py`, and
-- that sort is unstable, so on a tie the two characters swap places from
-- frame to frame -- a hundredth of a pixel is the smallest thing that
-- decides it and the largest thing nobody can see.
--
-- It rests on two facts, and stops being safe without either.  Engine `py`
-- values are always whole pixels (a step's progress is floored and a landing
-- snaps to `cell * 16`), so any fraction at all breaks the tie in the
-- player's favour.  And the nudge is only ever applied when `py % 1 == 0`,
-- which is what keeps an avatar standing still from drifting up the screen
-- a hundredth of a pixel per frame.
--
-- "Nobody can see it" is only true because it never leaves the sort.  The
-- renderer floors `py - camY` against a whole camera, so a hundredth of a
-- pixel there is a whole pixel on screen -- so src/Avatars.lua adds this
-- back on the two ways out of the avatar layer, the pose the renderer draws
-- from and the cell cellOf reports.  Subtracting and re-adding it is exact
-- in doubles at overworld magnitudes, so a compensated position is equal to
-- the original, not merely close.
M.AVATAR_DEPTH_NUDGE = 0.01

-- Running: hold B on foot and a tile takes half as long.
--
-- A divisor rather than a frame count, because the walk speed it divides is
-- not ours to know: 16 is vanilla, but a data pack may say otherwise, and
-- hardcoding 8 here would quietly *slow a modded runner down*.  Two is the
-- Gen 3+ figure -- running is bike-fast, which is what makes the bike still
-- worth getting on for its own reasons rather than for its speed.
M.RUN_DIVISOR = 2

-- What a remote avatar moving at the fast pace has its npc.stepFrames set
-- to.  One number for two ways of getting there: a sprinter and a cyclist
-- both cover a tile in 8 frames, so the wire says "fast" rather than "which"
-- and this count serves both.
--
-- NPCs get no movement.speed hook to divide: their pace is a field read
-- fresh each frame, and its unset default is NPC.lua's hardcoded
-- STEP_FRAMES = 16 -- the engine's NPC walk default, *not* the player's walk
-- speed, which the divisor above is deliberately never told.  So the count
-- is derived from that 16 rather than written out beside it: tuning
-- RUN_DIVISOR then moves the local runner and the remote avatar together,
-- and one speed stays one speed.  Two independent numbers would drift apart
-- on the first tune, and avatars pacing faster than the presence stream
-- describes strobe past RESYNC_DISTANCE -- which is exactly what remote
-- cyclists did for as long as the wire had no way to say they were fast.

-- feel solid follows from the pair: an invite is only offered when *both*
-- sides are unattached, and either member leaving ends it for both, because
-- with two people "the party continues without you" is not a thing that
-- exists.  Raising this number would not widen the feature, it would make

-- (who is waiting, who may join, what a no costs), src/CoopSim.lua is the
-- four-slot field, and src/CoopBattle.lua is the screen it is drawn on.
--
-- The field is the mod's own, because the engine has none: BattleState carries
-- exactly one active battler per side and TurnOrder compares a pair.  What sits
-- *under* the field is still the engine's -- damage, crits, types, STAB, the
-- badge boosts, the status records -- so a mon hits for the same number here as
-- it does in a wild battle.
--
-- Cap on fighters: two parties of PARTY_MAX. Written as a product rather than
-- the literal 4 so that the day PARTY_MAX moves, the side that has to move
-- with it is not a number somebody has to remember. NPC co-op may use fewer
-- (a one-monster trainer fills only one foe seat).

-- What identifies "the same fight" to two different clients.
--

-- crossing a route would be asked to join a fight three screens away.  The key
-- is built by Coop.battleKey from the map and the trainer's own identifiers,
-- so it is derived on both sides from the world rather than passed around and
-- trusted.
-- How many badge ids a client may claim. Gen 1 has eight and only four of
-- them boost a stat, so this is a bound on a payload rather than a rule about
-- the game -- generous enough that a mod adding badges is not cut off.
-- The most POKeMON a slot may bring, which is Gen 1's party size.
--
-- A bound on a *relayed* list rather than a rule about the game: the field
-- description crosses the wire from another player's client, and a party
-- length nobody checked is a battle that never ends -- every faint answered by

-- arrives as "BUG CATCHE" -- a box asking whether to join a friend against a
-- misspelt opponent. Sixteen is what the sentence has room for, since the

-- the label on its own row, and a text box is eighteen columns).
M.COOP_LABEL_MAX = 16

-- How long an unanswered co-op offer stands before it is dropped.
--
-- Long, and deliberately so: the whole point of WAIT FOR <friend> is that a
-- player is prepared to stand still until their partner walks over, and a
-- partner crossing two maps is an ordinary three minutes.  It exists at all so
-- that an offer whose owner wandered off and forgot it cannot sit on the
-- partner's client forever -- not to hurry anybody.
M.COOP_OFFER_TIMEOUT = 300

-- How long the four-way PARTY BATTLE ask waits for its three answers.  Shorter
-- than an offer because every one of the four is looking at a box right now,
-- and an ask that outlives the moment it was made is an ask somebody answers
-- yes to long after they stopped meaning it.
M.COOP_ASK_TIMEOUT = 60

-- How much longer a *client* waits before giving up on an ask than the hub
-- does.
--
-- The two clocks used to be the same number, and the asker's starts when it
-- sends while the hub's starts a round trip later -- so the client reliably
-- expired first, cleared its own `ask`, and said "nobody answered". The hub
-- still held one. The player could then pick PARTY BATTLE again, the hub would
-- drop it as a duplicate, and they were left pressing a button that did
-- nothing until the hub's own clock caught up.
--
-- A margin rather than a smaller number, because the hub is the one that has
-- to speak: it tells all four. The client giving up first is the case worth
-- ruling out.
M.COOP_ASK_GRACE = 10

-- How long a co-op battle's relay group may live before the hub reclaims it.
--
-- The belt to mmo.coop_leave's braces. A client that crashes mid-battle never
-- sends the goodbye and never disconnects cleanly enough to be dropped, and
-- without this its group would sit in the table for the life of the process.
-- An hour is far longer than any battle and far shorter than an uptime.
M.COOP_BATTLE_MAX = 3600

-- How long the host waits on a player who is connected but silent.
--
-- Generous, because it is a human choosing a move and the whole battle stops
-- until they do -- but finite, because a connected client that has stopped
-- answering (a wedged game, a laptop lid) is indistinguishable from one
-- thinking, and the other three cannot be made to wait on it forever. A slot
-- that misses this forfeits, which is the same thing that happens when its
-- player disconnects outright.
-- How long the field waits for a player to send out their next POKeMON.
--
-- Half the turn clock, and deliberately not the same number. A player still
-- picking a *move* blocks one turn; a player who has not answered a faint
-- blocks **everything** -- the field refuses to resolve while any slot is
-- awaiting, so the other three are sitting in front of a battle that cannot
-- move at all. It is also the easier decision of the two: a short list, and
-- one button. So the pause that costs the most is given the least rope.
M.COOP_CHOICE_TIMEOUT = 30

-- How long a wait may look like nothing before it starts explaining itself.
--
-- Under this, nothing is drawn: an ordinary turn has all four players deciding
-- at once and a clock that flashed up every turn would be noise. Past it, the
-- box says who is being waited for and counts down, because the difference
-- between "somebody is thinking" and "this has hung" is the whole of what a
-- player cannot tell from an empty screen.
M.COOP_WAIT_HINT = 5
-- Seconds between rotating which name the mediated/host-sim wait line shows
-- while several players are still choosing.
M.COOP_WAIT_ROTATE = 3

M.COOP_TURN_TIMEOUT = 60

-- How long a replayer waits on a silent host.
--
-- **Longer than the turn deadline, and that is the whole rule.** This clock
-- asks "has the client that decides everything said anything at all", and the
-- answer only means something once a healthy host would have had to speak. The
-- turn deadline is that guarantee: a turn opens, and within COOP_TURN_TIMEOUT
-- the host either resolves it or auto-picks for whoever is late and resolves it
-- anyway -- so a `res` lands inside 60 seconds of every turn opening. Silence
-- past that really is silence.
--
-- It used to be 30, which is *under* the turn budget, so a legitimately quiet
-- turn -- four players thinking, nobody late enough to be picked for -- tripped
-- every replayer into a warning and a resync as an **expected** state: a log
-- full of "the co-op battle has gone quiet" about a battle that was fine, and
-- three snapshot requests the host had to answer every slow turn.
--
-- The cost is honest and it is paid on the one path that matters: a host that
-- really has died is now declared after two expiries rather than one plus a
-- resync, so up to 150 seconds worst case (75 to ask, 75 to give up) instead of
-- 60. That is the right trade -- a dead host is rare and ends the battle either
-- way, while a quiet turn is ordinary and used to cost a false alarm every time.
M.COOP_STALL_TIMEOUT = 75

-- ------- mediated battles
--
-- The fight an *intermediator* runs: the dedicated hub, or a LAN host, owning
-- hit, crit, damage, status and the outcome, with both clients reduced to
-- sending choices and drawing what they are told.  The vocabulary is the seven
-- mmo.battle_* types in src/Wire.lua and the shapes beside them; these are the
-- numbers that vocabulary is bounded by.
--
-- Every one of them is mirrored in the JS twin under server/lib/, for the same
-- reason the rank dials are: two intermediators that time out differently are
-- two different games, and a client that accepts a party the hub refused would
-- upload a team into a battle that never opens.  They move together or not at
-- all.

-- Which co-op battle modes go through the intermediator rather than being
-- simulated by the host client.
--
-- **A co-op fight becomes mediated the moment its ruleset and every party have
-- arrived**, and nothing else engages the cut: both hubs keep forwarding
-- mmo.coop_relay until `record.sim` exists and refuse it from then on (see
-- src/Hub.lua's COOP_RELAY handler).  So the decision about whether a mode is
-- refereed is the decision about whether its clients upload, and this is where
-- that is written down rather than a branch inside the battle screen.
--
-- `coop_pvp` is on.  Four players, four seats, four connections that submit
-- choices -- and it is the mode where the host-authoritative arithmetic was the
-- real trust problem, because a modified host was deciding a ranked match
-- against players it was fighting.
--
-- `coop_npc` is on too, and it took the two things the intermediator was missing
-- rather than anything in this client:
--
--   1. *Two npc seats, not one.*  `openMediatedBattle` seats side b of a
--      coop_npc as two synthetic ids (`n<battle>a`, `n<battle>b`), and the
--      trainer's party -- uploaded by the host as one list, in send-out order --
--      is dealt back across them alternately, which is the inverse of the deal
--      src/Coop.lua made when it built the field.  One seat was a 2-on-1 where
--      the screen draws a 2-on-2, with the fourth box mapping to nothing.
--   2. *Something chooses for the npc.*  Both intermediators call the turn
--      machine's own auto-pick for every npc seat the moment a turn opens, so
--      the trainer answers in the same breath the field does.  It used to wait
--      out BATTLE_CHOICE_TIMEOUT and then auto-pick anyway -- a minute a turn,
--      which is not a battle.
--
-- Both are in src/Hub.lua and its twin in server/lib/relay.js, and they moved
-- together: a client on this line talking to a hub without them is the 2-on-1
-- that never resolves, which is what PROTOCOL is for.
--
-- **Not a host toggle.** coop_pvp / coop_npc / coop_wild are always hub-refereed.
-- The host-sim CoopSim path for those modes was removed so BattleSim and engine
-- ItemEffects cannot diverge mid-match. `CoopBattle.mediates` hard-codes the
-- mediated modes; this table stays as the documented surface for e2e / docs.
M.MEDIATED_COOP = { coop_pvp = true, coop_npc = true, coop_wild = true }

-- How long a battle waits for a player who has dropped mid-fight.
--
-- The window in which a crash, a dropped wifi or a closed lid is still

-- stood.  Past it the side forfeits, which is the whole reason the window is
-- finite -- the other player cannot be made to sit in front of a frozen field
-- forever on the chance somebody is rebooting.
--
-- Sixty, which is RANK_REPORT_GRACE's number and chosen the same way: long
-- enough to cover the reconnect a player can actually achieve (the client
-- redials the hub it already knows and replays one message), short enough that
-- the opponent reads it as an interruption rather than an abandonment.
M.BATTLE_RECONNECT_GRACE = 60

-- How long the intermediator waits on a connected player's choice before it
-- picks for them.
--
-- Its own constant rather than COOP_TURN_TIMEOUT, and the two happening to be
-- 60 is not the reason to merge them.  COOP_TURN_TIMEOUT is a *client* clock:
-- the host client running CoopSim used it to decide when to auto-pick, and the
-- replayers used COOP_STALL_TIMEOUT to decide when that host had died.  This
-- one is the intermediator's, on the far side of the wire, and it is the only
-- clock in a mediated fight that decides anything -- nothing is waiting on a
-- player's client to be alive, so there is no stall clock above it and no
-- grace margin below it.  Keeping them separate is what lets the co-op numbers
-- be retuned for the screen while this one is retuned for the hub.
M.BATTLE_CHOICE_TIMEOUT = 60

-- How long a turn may sit in `resolving` before the intermediator aborts.
--
-- Resolution is normally a single call with no player wait, so this is a wedge
-- detector rather than a clock anybody watches: half of BATTLE_CHOICE_TIMEOUT,
-- long enough that a slow host is not punished, short enough that a throw left
-- mid-resolve (Hub `receive` is pcall'd) cannot freeze the field forever. The
-- abort reason is the existing `timeout` token -- Wire already has a sentence
-- for it, and inventing `stuck` would be a phrasebook change for a case the
-- player cannot tell apart from "nobody answered".

-- `dir` holds three files, all original art shaped like the engine's own:
-- walk.png (16x96, six 16x16 frames), front.png (56x56, the trainer-card and
-- intro pic) and back.png (48x48, the battle back pic).
--
-- walk.png is original-ish silhouette work: modkit MK302 rejects perceptual
-- near-duplicates of the player's ROM-derived cache (blue.png / fisher.png
-- were Hamming ≤ 4 against earlier sheets). If you redraw these, re-run
-- `python3 tools/modkit.py lint mods/rby_mmo` before packing.
--
-- backScale is what a 48x48 back pic has to draw at, and it has to be a whole
-- number.  The plain battle view hands the registered scale to the draw call
-- verbatim, onto a nearest-neighbour canvas: at a fractional scale a source
-- pixel lands on one destination pixel in some columns and two in others, so
-- the sprite comes out visibly uneven rather than merely smaller or larger.
-- This mod shipped exactly that bug -- 64/48, chosen so 48x48 art would keep
-- the 64-pixel footprint the engine's own 32x32 back pics get from their
-- default 2x, because a taller trainer stands in the text box.  The footprint
-- was right and every third column was a pixel wide twice over.
--
-- 1 is the only whole number that works at this art size.  The feet sit on
-- the text-box top at every scale and the pic grows upward from there, so at
-- 2 it is 96 pixels tall and covers the whole field above the text box,
-- enemy pic and status boxes included; at 1 it is 48, the size a back pic
-- can actually be.  It also settles a disagreement between the two
-- battle views: the alternate 3D view already rounds every battle scale to
-- the nearest integer before drawing, so it has been showing these back pics
-- at 1x all along.  Both views now draw the same pic at the same size.
