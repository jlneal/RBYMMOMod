-- The turn machine: choices in, events out, and one party deciding.
--
-- The formula modules beside this one each answer a single question with no
-- memory.  This is the thing that holds the fight: it owns the field, the
-- clock, the RNG stream and the order the questions get asked in, and it is
-- the only file in src/BattleSim/ with state.  A battle brokered here is
-- resolved by *one* process -- the LAN host or the Node hub -- and the clients
-- receive an ordered stream of events they draw.  They are never asked what
-- happened, which is the whole reason a modified client cannot roll its own
-- damage any more.
--
-- **The RNG order is the contract.**  The twin under server/lib/battle/ has to
-- consume draws at exactly the same points or the same seed produces a
-- different fight, so every draw site is spelled out here and every one of
-- them is conditional in a way both runtimes can reproduce:
--
--   1. a speed tie-break byte, one per group of equally fast actors;
--   2. one gate byte per actor whose monster has a gating status;
--   3. one gate byte per actor whose monster is confused;
--   4. per move that is actually used: accuracy byte, multihit-count byte
--      (TWO_TO_FIVE only), crit byte, damage roll, side-chance byte
--      (damaging hits only), in that order, and none of them drawn when an
--      earlier step ended the move (a missed move draws no crit byte).
--
-- Nothing else rolls.  Residuals, switches, items and the clock are all
-- deterministic, so a battle replays from its seed plus the choice log.
--
-- **Policies chosen where Gen 1 had no answer**, each one written down because
-- the two runtimes have to pick the same one:
--
--   * *Speed ties* break on a single RNG byte per tied group: below 128 the
--     side-a member goes first, otherwise the group reverses.  One draw per
--     group rather than per pair, so a 2v2 with four equal speeds costs one
--     byte on both runtimes.
--   * *Running* is a concession, not an escape.  A mediated fight is between
--     two people who agreed to it, and Gen 1's flee roll exists to let you
--     leave a wild encounter -- so one side running loses the battle with
--     reason `run`, and both sides running is a draw.  Mirrored: the policy
--     reads the same from either seat, which is what stops "I fled" and "they
--     fled" being two different stories.
--   * *Items* apply a hand-authored Gen1 heal/status table by id (Potion,
--     Full Restore, Revive, Ether, …) — locked twin of public amounts, not a
--     port of engine ItemEffects. Unknown ids announce "But it failed" and
--     still spend the turn. Bags are client claims (sheet trust locked; hub
--     has no ROM inventory truth); PROTOCOL 15 holds/spends mid-fight only.
--   * *Forced lock-in* (recharge, trap, thrash, …) fills choices on `_openTurn`
--     so the mediated path never opens a menu the cartridge would withhold; a
--     turn where *nobody* still owes waits for the next `tick` before resolving
--     so clients see a turn boundary for wait-lines / anim pacing. Trap residual
--     uses the first-hit damage store; the trapper emits continue narration +
--     anim without re-rolling `_useMove`.
--   * *Status moves* run through Effects.lua. Metronome picks from host-uploaded
--     `metronomePool` on the ruleset (from MediatedBattle.snapshotRuleset);
--     without a pool it says "But nothing happened".
--   * *Physical / Special* follow Gen1 type categories via host-uploaded
--     `specialTypes` on the ruleset (indices into the uploaded chart). Absent
--     specialTypes keeps every damaging move on atk/def.
--   * A *faint sends the next living monster in party order*, immediately and
--     without asking.  The original stops and asks; asking here would mean a
--     second kind of choice phase with its own deadline and its own forfeit
--     rule, and a fight that can hang between two turns is a worse v1 than one
--     that picks in party order.
--   * *Residuals* run in field order (side a, then side b), not in the speed
--     order the moves used.  Only the order two burns tick in is at stake, and
--     field order is the one both runtimes can reproduce without carrying the
--     turn's sort into the end-of-turn step.
--   * A *timeout* / NPC auto-picks with bag cures & heals (≤50% HP), X-items,
--     SE damage, status / setup reading, and SE bench switches (deterministic
--     heuristics — not a full TrainerAI port) -- and the fight continues.  It
--     does not end the battle -- the player who went to make a sandwich loses
--     a turn, not the match.
--   * *Struggle* when every move is out of PP: synthetic STRUGGLE (power 50,
--     type normal), no PP spent, recoil floor(damage/4) minimum 1 after a hit.
--   * The choice clock is *suspended while anybody is disconnected*, because
--     the grace timer is already counting for that player and two deadlines
--     racing would decide the match on whichever fired first.
--
-- Nothing here raises.  Bad input is refused with a nil-plus-reason from
-- `create` or a plain `false` from `submitChoice`, because every caller is
-- downstream of a mod callback where a bare error() is a loader rule
-- violation -- and a fight that stops mid-turn is worse than one that declines
-- a malformed choice.
--
-- No love, no engine modules, no mod facade.
