-- The event vocabulary a mediated battle speaks, frozen.
--
-- Every visible thing that happens in a brokered fight leaves this file as one
-- small table, and a client draws the stream rather than the state: the
-- intermediator did the rolls, so the only thing left to send is what to show.
-- Getting the *shapes* wrong is therefore not a cosmetic bug -- an event whose
-- fields the screen cannot read is a turn the two players saw differently.
--
-- **The vocabulary is mirrored from src/Wire.lua, not imported from it, and
-- that is deliberate.**  Wire owns the sanitiser (`M.BATTLE_EVENTS`,
-- `M.battleEvent`) and pulls in Config to do it; everything under
-- src/BattleSim/ has to run with no mod facade, no Config and no engine at all,
-- because the same rules exist a second time in JavaScript under
-- server/lib/battle/.  A copy that can drift is the price of that, so
-- tests/battle_sim_turn.lua closes the loop the only honest way: it loads Wire
-- when Wire happens to be loadable and asserts kind-for-kind that the mirror is
-- still faithful, and that every event this file builds survives
-- `Wire.battleEvent` unchanged.
--
-- The field whitelist is the sharp edge here.  `Wire.battleEvent` rebuilds an
-- event from a fixed set of keys, so a field invented in this directory does
-- not arrive somewhere else looking optional -- it does not arrive at all.
-- `M.build` enforces the same whitelist at the point of construction, which
-- turns "the client never showed the crit" into a failure in the sim's own
-- suite instead of a silent drop three modules downstream.
--
-- Nothing here raises, and nothing here reads a clock: an event is a value.
--
-- No love, no engine modules, no mod facade.

--

-- machine promises to send, so the JS twin and the screen have one place to
-- read the contract off instead of inferring it from a sim run.  Optional
-- fields are marked, and the two readings that are easy to get backwards are
-- spelled out:
--
--   * `slot` on an event is a **field slot** (0..3: side a takes 0 and 1, side
--     b takes 2 and 3) -- it is *not* the party index a `switch` choice names.
--     Same word, two numbers, and the one the event carries is always about
--     somebody who is out on the field.
--   * a `status` event with a `status` field means the condition was
--     *inflicted*; the same event with no `status` field means it **cleared**.
--     There is no "none" token in Wire's status vocabulary to say it with, and
--     `text` carries the sentence either way.
--
-- `turn` puts the 1-based turn number in `amount`, which is the only numeric
-- field it has and is compared rather than sized, so a long fight is fine.
