-- The hub, as pure logic.
--
-- This is the same relay `server/hub.js` implements, ported to Lua so a
-- player can host from inside the game. It owns who is connected, where
-- they last said they were, which two players are paired, and the player
-- cap the host chose. Trade still runs inside the two clients on the
-- engine's own link code, and its `mmo.relay` payloads pass through unread.
--
-- **Battle does not.** From PROTOCOL 10 a battle this hub brokers is
-- resolved *here*, by src/BattleSim/Turn.lua, and the clients receive an
-- ordered stream of events they draw rather than rolling their own. The
-- mediated-battles section below is that plumbing, and server/lib/relay.js
-- runs the same one over the same message types -- a client cannot tell
-- which of the two hosting paths refereed its fight.
--
-- **No sockets appear anywhere below.** Everything talks to *peer handles*
-- -- any table answering `:send(msg)` and `:close()`. `HostServer` supplies
-- socket-backed ones; the host's own client supplies an in-process one; the
-- suite supplies fakes. That is what lets the cap, the scope routing and
-- the session pairing be tested under plain luajit, which has no luasocket
-- and no LOVE.
--
-- Every hub carries a join code.  Hello is answered with a nonce and the
-- peer owes an HMAC of it keyed by the code (plan §3.2); the code itself
-- never crosses the wire, and a peer that has not answered is on nobody's
-- roster.  server/lib/relay.js runs the same handshake message for message,
-- so a joining client cannot tell the two hosting paths apart.
--
-- This file will still build a hub with no code, and that is on purpose:
-- it is pure logic, and the uncoded path is the only way the suite can
-- exercise admit-at-hello alongside admit-after-challenge under plain
-- luajit.  **Only the suite may make one.**  Every hub a player can reach
-- comes from HostServer:start, which refuses outright without a code, so
-- an uncoded hub means "a fixture", never "a LAN game left open" -- there
-- is no longer any way for a host to ask for one.
--
-- Everything arriving here is untrusted -- it comes from another player's
-- process, and a modified one is a normal thing to meet -- so every field
-- is re-derived through Wire before it is believed.

-- ------- the entropy pool
--
-- Both credentials this mod mints are drawn from here: the challenge nonces
-- below, and the join code src/Client.lua offers on the HOST screen.  One
-- pool, because they are one process's worth of unpredictability and
-- splitting it would halve both.  It lives in this file rather than one of
-- its own because Client already reaches Hub (through HostServer) while Hub
-- must never reach Client -- this is the only side of that edge a shared
-- pool can sit on without a cycle.
--
-- **What it is.** A 256-bit SHA-256 state that varying material is folded
-- into over the whole session -- frame durations, os.clock() and its
-- deltas, live heap size, love.math.random() where it exists, the timing of
-- the player's own button presses -- plus a short burst of os.clock()
-- scheduling jitter taken at the moment of a draw.  Every draw hashes the
-- state with a counter and then ratchets the state forward, so no two draws
-- repeat and a leaked draw does not give up the state that made it.
--
-- **What it is not: a CSPRNG.** There is no such source reachable from a
-- mod that declares only `network` -- LOVE ships no randomBytes,
-- love.math.random is a seeded xorshift, and /dev/urandom would mean a
-- filesystem permission this mod does not have.  Honest numbers, since the
-- format of a join code implies 80 bits and this does not deliver them:
--
--   * Drawn cold, before anything has been stirred in, the pool holds only
--     an instantaneous sample -- heap size, a fresh table's address, the
--     wall clock to the second, the CPU clock.  That is roughly 35-45 bits
--     against someone who knows the machine and roughly when it started.
--   * Drawn from a game that has been playing for even a few seconds, the
--     pool has absorbed hundreds of frame-timing and clock samples whose
--     low microseconds are genuine scheduling noise.  The input entropy
--     there runs well past 80 bits; what we are willing to *claim* is 64,
--     because the per-sample jitter is an estimate rather than a
--     measurement and nothing here health-tests the pool.
--
-- So: substantially better than one os.time() sample, and still not what a
-- hub facing the open internet should rely on -- that one is the dedicated
-- server in server/, whose nonces come from crypto.randomBytes.

-- ------- friends
--
-- The hub owns exactly one part of this feature: carrying a friend ask to the
-- player it names, and *keeping* it when that player is not here.  The lists
-- themselves live in the two clients (src/Friends.lua's header says why they
-- cannot live here), so nothing below records who is friends with whom -- it
-- records who still owes an answer to whom.
--
-- Everything is keyed by trainer name rather than connection id, because a
-- friendship outlives the connection that made it and a held ask has, by
-- definition, no connection left to hang on.  Wire.nameKey is the fold -- trainer names, upper-cased -- not
-- Rank.keyOf (playerId), because friendships are keyed by the name you play as, so "the same name" means one thing on this hub.
--
-- Kept in step with server/lib/relay.js, which does all of this over its own
-- client table: the same client dials a dedicated hub and a game hosted from
-- inside somebody's copy, so a rule only one of them enforces is a rule that
-- holds on one of the two hosting paths and not the other.

-- Whoever is connected under this name right now, or nil.
--
-- First match wins, and the iteration order of self.clients decides which --
-- which is fine and is why nothing here is drawn from it: two players wearing
-- one unclaimed name is a real state, and either of them is an equally correct
-- answer to "deliver this now rather than holding it".  A wrong guess costs a
-- misdelivered box, not a friendship: the receiving client answers under its
-- own name, and the answer is matched back against the hold by name.
