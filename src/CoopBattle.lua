-- The 2-on-2 battle screen: four monsters on one field.
--
-- `CoopSim` is the rules; this is the screen. It is a plain state object of the
-- shape `src/core/StateStack.lua` expects -- enter, exit, update, draw,
-- isOpaque -- pushed through the mod's own `screens` registry, which is why
-- the mod can own a whole battle without touching `game.stack` directly.
--
-- ------- why host-authoritative, and not four-way lockstep
--
-- The engine's `LinkBattle` is lockstep: two peers run the same simulation off
-- one shared seed and exchange only choices. That works at two because both
-- ends draw from the same RNG stream in the same order, and the tie-break is
-- inverted on one side so the two agree.
--
-- At four it stops being cheap. Every client would have to consume the same
-- draws in the same order across four action resolutions, four faints and four
-- send-outs, and any one of them lagging a message would desync the field
-- rather than one battler. So one client simulates and the other three replay
-- the **events** it produces. The cost is honest -- the host decides, and a
-- modified host could decide wrongly -- and it is the same trust the engine's
-- own host-authoritative branch already takes for `action`/`event` in a link
-- battle, one player wider.
--
-- The upshot for this file: for **hub-refereed** coop modes (always the three
-- in Config.MEDIATED_COOP — `coop_pvp` / `coop_npc` / `coop_wild`), the
-- intermediator decides and this screen draws an ordered `mmo.battle_event`
-- stream — same as MediatedBattle. `CoopSim` is still constructed to hold the
-- field the screen is drawn from, and is not asked to *decide* anything. See
-- "the intermediator, when there is one" near the bottom.
--
-- ------- what this covers
--
-- All four battle commands, and the whole move-effect surface.
--
-- FIGHT resolves through `src/CoopField.lua`, which is a BattleState-shaped
-- object over the four slots -- so the move that runs is the engine's own
-- `performMove` and every `move_effects` record behind it. Charge moves charge,
-- Substitute absorbs, Hyper Beam recharges, Metronome calls, multi-hit hits,
-- recoil recoils, stat stages move. None of that is reimplemented here; see
-- CoopField's header for why it did not have to be.
--
-- ITEM goes through the engine's own `ItemEffects.use`, so a potion heals what
-- a potion heals and an item that refuses mid-battle refuses in the engine's
-- words. SWITCH costs the turn, as it does in the original.
--
-- A thrown ball is **refused** against a trainer (`coop_npc` / host-sim), and
-- that is the complete behaviour rather than a missing one: every monster on
-- the far side belongs to somebody, and Gen 1 does not let you catch somebody
-- else's. It is refused in the original's own words, taken from the game's
-- text table. Against **`coop_wild`** the far side is wildlife, so balls are
-- legal — the referee resolves them (speed-ordered among ball choices).
--
-- RUN is three questions wearing one label, and they are answered separately.
-- Against an **NPC trainer** it is the original's question and keeps the
-- original's refusal, word for word. Against **two other players** it is a
-- question Gen 1 never had to ask -- and the answer is yes, with the consent of
-- the partner who shares the loss. Against a **partied wild** (`coop_wild`) it
-- is solo-wild semantics: either player flees unilaterally, no consent ask.
-- See "RUN, in a battle where the other side is people" below for the PvP half.

-- ------- lifecycle

-- Announced to any mod that cares, on this mod's own event names.
--
-- **Not `battle.started` / `battle.ended`.** `mod.events:emit` is namespaced by
-- the loader -- a mod may only emit `mod.<id>.*` -- and that rule is a good
-- one: it is what stops any installed mod forging an engine event and having
-- every listener believe the engine said it. So a co-op battle says so under
-- its own name, and a mod that wants to hear about one listens for that.
--
-- The payload carries the same three things the engine's own battle events
-- carry, plus the slot roster, because "who is in it" is the question a
-- four-way battle raises that a 1v1 does not.
-- Tell the rest of the game a co-op battle happened.
--
-- **The engine's own `battle.started` and `battle.ended` never fire for one**,
-- and cannot be made to. `battle.started` is emitted from `BattleState:enter`,
-- and the trainer battle this displaced is taken off the stack before it ever
-- enters; `battle.ended` is emitted from `BattleState:finish`, and the co-op
-- flow calls that battle's `onFinish` directly rather than finishing it. So a
-- mod watching the engine's events sees nothing at all -- not a co-op battle
-- starting, and not a trainer being beaten by two people.
--
-- A mod cannot emit an engine event: `mod.events:emit` is namespaced to
-- `mod.<id>.*` precisely so that no mod can forge one. So these are the mod's
-- own, under `mod.rby_mmo.`, and the payload is shaped to be worth listening
-- to rather than to be a notification -- a listener that has to reach into
-- `battle` for everything might as well not have been told.

-- ------- RUN, in a battle where the other side is people
--
-- **A party cannot leave one of these on one person's say-so.** Two players
-- share a side, share the loss, and share the ranked points that go with it --
-- so one of them pressing RUN is a proposal, not a decision, and the whole of
-- this section is the shape of that proposal.
--
-- Four states, and every one of them is torn down by something that cannot be
-- forgotten:
--
--   asking    -- the asker, waiting. Nothing has been committed: their slot
--                still owes the turn an action, so the deadline treats them
--                exactly as it treats anybody who has not answered.
--   deciding  -- the partner, holding a two-answer picker over whatever they
--                were doing. Offered to a partner who is *spectating* too:
--                their monsters are gone, their half of the decision is not.
--   fleeing   -- the answer was yes; the host's closing events are on their way.
--   refused   -- the answer was no; a line to read, and then the command menu
--                back exactly as it was left, with the turn's own clock still
--                running.
--
-- ------- what rides on the wire, and why the hub never had to learn it
--
-- Two payload kinds inside the battle's existing relay envelope
-- (Wire.COOP_RUN_ASK / Wire.COOP_RUN_ANSWER). Both hubs forward a co-op payload
-- unread -- shape is the only thing they judge -- so this needed no hub change
-- on either side, and a client built before it drops both through its inbound
-- dispatch without a branch. A mixed-version battle therefore degrades to
-- today's behaviour rather than to a hang: the ask is never answered, and the
-- turn deadline files it as a refusal like any other.
--
-- Neither message names a slot. Who asked is the `from` the hub stamps, and
-- which slot that is, is a fact the receiving client reads off its own copy of
-- the field -- the same rule the `act` handler follows, and for the same
-- reason: a slot named in a payload is a slot a modified client could claim.
--
-- ------- and the host is still the only one that may end a battle
--
-- A yes does not end anything by itself. It is *reported*, and the host
-- resolves the flee -- and only after checking it saw the ask that a yes is an
-- answer to, so a modified client cannot forfeit its partner's battle by
-- posting consent nobody asked for.

-- Is this a battle between four players, or two players and a trainer?
--
-- Answered off the field rather than off the trainer record, because that is
-- the description all four clients were built from: a co-op battle against an
-- NPC carries two ownerless slots and a party battle carries none.
-- `self.trainer` would be a weaker test -- a script-driven battle need not name
-- a trainer at all -- and this is the question the run rule turns on.

-- COOP_RELAY handler) -- so on the mediated path there is no channel left to put
-- a question on. There is no room in the mmo.battle_* vocabulary for one either:
-- a choice says what was pressed, and "may I?" is not a choice.
--
-- What is kept is the half of the consent flow that was protecting against an
-- accident rather than against a partner: the picker, and its cursor starting on
-- NO. See RUN_DEFAULT -- the prompt lands at the exact moment all four players
-- are holding A through the last turn's narration, and one already-travelling
-- press must not forfeit a ranked battle. So the player is asked to confirm,
-- with the safe answer under the cursor, and their partner is not consulted.

-- Restoring the veto is an additive wire change (a run-consent pair inside the
-- battle vocabulary, refereed like everything else) and belongs with whoever
-- teaches the intermediator about it.

-- The field, laid out the way the modern games lay a double battle out --
-- inside a screen a third of their width.
--
-- **The constraint first, because it decides everything else.** A Gen 1 battle
-- pic is 56x56. Four of them plus four status readouts plus a six-row message
-- box do not fit in 160x144 -- not staggered, not overlapped, not anywhere.
-- The first version of this screen pretended otherwise and the result was the
-- ally half of the field drawn underneath the command box: two garbled strips
-- where CHARIZARD and PIKACHU should have been, and their pictures invisible
-- behind it.
--
-- So the pics are drawn at half scale. That is the one lever that makes the
-- whole thing fit, and it is spent deliberately: **half is an integer scale**,
-- so a 56x56 pic lands on 28x28 with every pixel doubled down cleanly rather
-- than resampled into mush -- which is what any of 0.6, 0.75 or "fit to box"
-- would have done to art drawn for one exact size.
--
-- What that buys is the modern arrangement:
--
--   * four monsters visible at once, staggered diagonally so the pair on each
--     side reads as two things at different depths rather than one wide smear;
--   * the foes' two status readouts stacked in the top-left, away from their
--     pictures, and the allies' two stacked in the bottom-right, away from
--     theirs -- which is where Gen 3 puts them;
--   * a full-width message and command box in its usual place.
--
-- Every glyph, box and HP bar is still the engine's own (Font, HudTiles), so a
-- palette or asset mod owns the look of this exactly as it owns a wild battle.

-- Real size on the field. Foes stay 1x in the top-right quarter; the near
-- (bottom) pair draws larger and sits on the message-box lip -- there is
-- empty field under 1x backs that classic Gen 1 spent on a 2x player pic.

-- ------- nobody is saying anything
--
-- A disconnect is handled elsewhere (peerGone). This is the other shape of the

-- connected and has simply stopped answering. A wedged game, a closed laptop, a
-- network that drops packets without dropping the socket -- from the outside
-- all three look exactly like somebody taking their time.
--
-- **Three clocks live here, and they are three different questions.** Named,
-- because a clock nobody can name is a clock somebody re-uses for the wrong
-- silence -- which is exactly how the old self-forfeit came about.
--
--   * the **turn deadline** (`turnOpened`, COOP_TURN_TIMEOUT): host-only. One
--     per turn, over every player slot including the host's own. On expiry the
--     late slots are auto-picked (see `autoPickLate`) and the turn resolves.
--   * the **replacement-choice clock** (`waitClock`, COOP_CHOICE_TIMEOUT):
--     host-only, and untouched by any of this. A slot awaiting a send-out
--     freezes the whole field rather than one turn, so it gets the shorter
--     rope and a different mechanism -- a forced send-out, not an auto-pick.
--   * the **host-silence clock** (`hostClock`, COOP_STALL_TIMEOUT): on the
--     three replayers, who cannot resolve anything and can only ask. Two things
--     about what it measures, and both were wrong in their own direction: it
--     counts silence *from the host* rather than silence on the wire (see the
--     reset in `drainNet`), and it counts from the **handover** -- the moment
--     the host owes an answer -- rather than from the host's last message,
--     which would fold the whole of that message's narration into the silence
--     it is meant to be measuring.
--
-- One more thing lives here that is not a clock in that sense either: the
-- bottomed-out wait below (`wedgeAsked`). It is the promise `waitLine` printed
-- being kept -- when the number on screen runs out with nothing to show for
-- it, this asks the host for the field rather than sitting on "(0)".
--
-- `waitShown` is not a clock in that sense: it is how long the turn has been
-- open, ticked on all four purely so the line can appear and count down against
-- the deadline above. It enforces nothing.

-- ------- how much longer than the host's own deadline a wait is given
--
-- The wait below is bounded by the host's deadline, not by this client's copy
-- of the number -- and the two do not start together. Every client stamps its
-- countdown at *its own* handover, and a client that read the last batch faster
-- than the host reaches that moment first; on top of that the host's answer has
-- to travel. So asking at exactly COOP_TURN_TIMEOUT would fire on every turn
-- the host lets run to its deadline, on all three replayers at once, for a
-- battle with nothing wrong with it -- and each pointless snapshot would clear
-- `acted` (the wait line then misnaming who is late) and reset `waitShown` (the
-- countdown jumping back to 60), which is the same number lying again in a new
-- way.
--
-- Borrowed rather than invented, and from the closest analogue there is:
-- Config pairs COOP_ASK_TIMEOUT with COOP_ASK_GRACE for exactly this shape of
-- question -- "how much slack on top of a sixty-second budget before the side
-- that is waiting concludes the answer is never coming". This is that question
-- asked about a different sixty. (A constant of this mod's own would have to
-- live in Config.lua, which this change does not own.)

  -- dropped in either direction wedges it: an `act` that never arrived leaves
  -- the host waiting for an answer this client believes it gave, and a `res`
  -- that never arrived leaves this client waiting for a turn the host believes
  -- it sent. Either way the countdown on screen runs to zero and sits there.
  --
  -- Neither clock below covered it. `hostClock` is reset by *any* traffic --
  -- another player's `act`, the host's answer to somebody else's resync -- so
  -- in a chatty group it never reaches COOP_STALL_TIMEOUT at all; and even at
  -- 75 seconds it is longer than the 60 this client is counting down. The only
  -- thing that unwedged the battle was the host's own turn deadline, a full
  -- minute later, which then auto-picked away the turn this player had already
  -- taken.
  --

-- ------- and what the answer does to a client that was stuck
--
-- A snapshot has always put the *field* right. It never put the **screen**
-- right, and that is the other half of the "(0)" freeze: a client wedged in
-- `wait` -- because the turn it answered never came back -- had its HP numbers
-- corrected and was left sitting in the same answered-and-waiting state, with
-- no menu, for as long as the battle lasted.
--
-- So a snapshot that answers a wedged wait hands the box back. Whatever this
-- client committed to is now either resolved (the field it has just been given
-- is the proof) or was never received; both readings end the same way, with the
-- player owed a menu. Committing again costs nothing on the wire -- the host
-- keys `pending` by slot, so a second answer replaces the first rather than
-- adding to it, and nothing about the sim moves either way.
--
-- It is not free in the **bag**, though, and that is why the refund happens
-- first. `updateItem` debits the item at the moment of committing, because only
-- this client owns its inventory, and `owed` holds exactly one id -- so a
-- player who picked a POTION, was unwedged, and picked one again would be
-- debited twice and refunded once. The turn being reopened here is by
-- definition unresolved, which is precisely the condition `refundUnspent` was
-- written for.
--
-- `acted` goes with it, because it is a claim about a turn this client has just
-- been told it is not in step with: keeping it would leave the wait line naming
-- people who have answered and omitting people who have not.
--
-- Only for a wait this client actually flagged (see `tickStalls`). An ordinary
-- resync -- one asked for because a turn number had a gap in it -- must not
-- reopen a menu behind the batch of messages it is already playing.

-- ------- the intermediator, when there is one
--
-- The third path promised in the header, and the shape of it is deliberately the
-- same three jobs src/MediatedBattle.lua does for a 1v1:
--
--   1. upload what we are bringing -- `mmo.battle_party` per seat, and on the
--      host `mmo.battle_ruleset` -- before the fight opens;
--   2. put a choice on the wire when a turn opens;
--   3. apply the ordered `mmo.battle_event` stream to a screen.
--
-- What is *not* here is a second renderer. Every event is translated into the
-- co-op event vocabulary `playEvents` already speaks and handed to it, so a
-- refereed turn drains through the same queue, the same bar animations, the same
-- faint slides and the same message dwell as a host-simulated one. That is the
-- point: a player must not be able to tell which of the two ran their battle,
-- and the way to guarantee that is for there to be one screen rather than two
-- that look alike.
--
-- The translation is the whole of the risk, so the two readings that are easy to
-- get backwards are named:
--
--   * a **field slot** on the wire is 0..3 (side a takes 0 and 1, side b takes 2
--     and 3, per src/BattleSim/events.lua) while this screen numbers its slots
--     1..4 in a1,a2,b1,b2 order. They are not the same number and the map
--     between them is built from the hub's own roster, not from the arithmetic
--     that happens to line up today -- see `medMap`.
--   * a `switch` **choice** names a party index; a `send` **event** names a field
--     slot. Same word, two numbers.
--
-- Batching matters as much as translation. Events arrive one per message, and
-- `playEvents` closes every open menu -- so applying them one at a time would
-- take the move list away from a player mid-decision every time the referee said
-- anything. They are collected instead and played when the referee closes the
-- batch (`turn`, or `over`), which makes an arriving turn look exactly like the
-- single `res` the client-simulated path sends.

-- Is this mode hub-refereed? Always for Config.MEDIATED_COOP
-- (`coop_pvp` / `coop_npc` / `coop_wild`) — not a Config toggle beyond that
-- table. Host-sim for those modes was removed (BattleSim vs engine
-- ItemEffects must not diverge). CoopSim remains for field layout / tests.

-- pair of players meets a pair of monsters. Taking one from each slot in turn
-- gives back the original order -- and order is the whole of what is at stake
-- here, because the referee sends the next living monster out in party order and
-- never asks. Concatenating instead would have a gym leader lead with the
-- monster it meant to finish on.
--
-- One party and not two, because the intermediator seats one npc: see
-- Config.MEDIATED_COOP's first reason.

-- invent a second trainer slot. See `uploadMediated`'s coop_wild branch.

-- lines of one that is still playing: dismissing a line leaves `shown` empty
-- for one tick before the next is popped, and a fallback drawn into that gap
-- flashed for a single frame between every pair of battle lines -- most
-- visibly the "X is choosing... (n)" countdown while a replacement pause
-- overlapped a batch, reported as "the battle kinda flickers during a moment
-- of waiting". Mid-batch, an empty frame is the original's own page gap.

-- it is the game stopping, for four people, mid-battle. The mod's own rule is
-- that a broken renderer costs a display and never the game, and a co-op
-- battle is the one screen in this mod that draws enough moving parts to earn
-- the guard. Warned once, then quietly, so a failure that repeats every frame
-- does not become the log.
