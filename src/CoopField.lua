-- A BattleState-shaped object over a four-slot field.
--
-- **This is the file that makes a co-op battle a real battle rather than a
-- damage calculator.**
--
-- The first cut of this mod reimplemented the turn: roll accuracy, compute
-- damage, subtract HP. That gets you a fight, and it gets you nothing else --
-- no Fly, no Substitute, no Hyper Beam recharge, no stat stages, no Bide, no
-- recoil, no Metronome. Every one of those lives in the engine's
-- `move_effects` registry, and the registry looked unreachable because it is
-- driven by `BattleState`, which is 1v1.
--
-- It is not unreachable, and the reason is worth stating plainly, because it
-- is the whole design:
--
--   **`EffectRegistry`, `MoveEffects` and `StatusRegistry` never read
--   `battle.player` or `battle.enemy`.** Not once. `makeCtx` takes `user` and
--   `target` as arguments, and everything else it wants from the battle it
--   asks for through a method -- `sayNext`, `applyDamage`, `computeDamage`,
--   `accuracyRoll`, `onFaint`, `sideOf`, `performMove`, and about eight more.
--   `BattleState:performMove` is the same: 200 lines, and not one of them
--   mentions either side by name.
--
-- So the pair-shaped thing in the engine is not the effect system. It is
-- `BattleState`'s *bookkeeping* -- which two battlers are out, whose party
-- they came from, where their pictures go. Replace that, keep the rest.
--
-- Which is exactly what this is: a table whose `__index` chain ends at
-- `BattleState`, so every generic method is the engine's own code running
-- unmodified, with the handful that assume two battlers overridden below.
-- `performMove` here **is** `BattleState.performMove`. Fly charges because
-- the engine charges it; Substitute absorbs because the engine absorbs it.
--
-- The overrides, and why each one has to be:
--
--   * `onFaint`   -- BattleState's sends out the next mon from *the* party and
--                    hands out exp; a slot owns its own party and there are
--                    four of them.
--   * `sideOf`    -- two sides indexed by `isPlayer`; here a side has two
--                    slots, and a battler's side is its slot's.
--   * `cancelMoveAnim` -- reads `self.player`/`self.enemy` to un-hide a
--                    digging pic. Same job, resolved through the slots.
--   * the queue drains to **events** rather than to a renderer, because three
--     other clients have to replay it.
--
-- Nothing here is a copy of engine logic. Every override is bookkeeping the
-- engine could not have done for four slots, and everything else is left
-- alone on purpose -- a second implementation of Gen 1's move effects would
-- drift from the first one the day either changed.

  -- built". `F5` in dev mode re-requires the engine's modules, and a cache

  --
  -- BattleState's queue rows are consumed by its own renderer a frame at a
  -- time. Here they are consumed by `drain` below and turned into the event
  -- list the other three clients replay, so a row that only means something
  -- to a 1v1 screen (a wait, a menu) is dropped rather than faked. Drain rows
  -- are *not* among the dropped ones any more: they are the engine's own
  -- pacing for the HP bar, one per strike with the stop it should halt at, and
  -- throwing them away is what made a multi-hit move show one silent jump
  -- instead of five. `fn` rows are *run*, because that is where the engine
  -- parks the state changes that go with an animation.

  -- Animations are named in the events so every client can apply its own
  -- OPTIONS toggle while replaying the same turn.  In particular this must

  -- The engine schedules one of these per HP change, carrying the battler and
  -- the HP its bar is allowed to stop at. That pair is the whole of Gen 1's
  -- pacing: a multi-hit move takes every strike off the model while the turn
  -- is still being queued, so the *rows* are what remember that the bar should
  -- have paused five times on the way down.
  --
  -- It is kept, not dropped. The row is carried through to `M.drain` below and
  -- becomes an event, so the four screens animate the same descent instead of
  -- each snapping to whatever HP the mon happened to hold when the turn ended.
  -- `drain` holds the battler itself rather than a flag because that is the
  -- only handle on *whose* bar this is; when the engine calls with no battler
  -- (a poison tick, a Recover) the row still has to be here and the same
  -- length, because the `nextInsert` cursor counts rows and `cancelMoveAnim`
  -- indexes past them -- so it keeps a bare marker that resolves to no slot
  -- and is skipped downstream.
