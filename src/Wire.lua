-- The wire vocabulary, and the sanitisers every inbound field goes through.
--
-- Two rules hold everywhere below.
--
-- 1. Every message type is prefixed "mmo.".  src/link/Net.lua intercepts
--    four unprefixed control types on a relay connection -- "hosted",
--    "paired", "join_error" and "peer_gone" -- and swallows them before
--    they reach the inbox.  Staying in our own namespace means the hub can
--    never accidentally drive Net's 1v1 pairing state machine.
--
-- 2. Nothing that arrives off the network is trusted.  Every field is
--    re-derived here into a known type and range before any other module
--    sees it, because the peer on the other end is a stranger's process,
--    not our own code.  A field that fails to sanitise takes its whole
--    message with it (nil) rather than arriving half-formed.
--
-- Pure data and string handling: no love, no engine modules, so the suite
-- can drive the whole protocol headlessly.

M.COOP_LEAVE     = "mmo.coop_leave"

-- ------- friends
--
-- Three types, all three travelling in both directions the way PARTY_INVITE
-- does -- the field set says which way it is going.
--
-- **They are addressed by *name*, not by connection id, everywhere except the
-- ask itself.**  A friendship outlives the connection that made it: the whole
-- feature is a list that still has somebody on it tomorrow, and an id is
-- minted per connection, so a name is the only handle that means the same
-- thing twice.  The ask is the exception because it can only ever be made
-- against somebody standing in front of you, so it names the id it is offered
-- to and the hub answers by name from there on.
--
--   FRIEND_ASK    -- outbound { to }, the id of the player being asked.
--                    Inbound { from, name } -- `from` is their id when they
--                    are still connected and absent when the hub is
--                    delivering an ask it held while this player was away,
--                    which is exactly the case the name exists for.
--   FRIEND_ANSWER -- outbound { toName, accept }, inbound { name, accept }.
--                    A yes from the asked side; a no is the same message with
--                    accept false, because "they said no" and "they have not
--                    answered yet" are the two things a player most needs
--                    told apart.
--   FRIEND_REMOVE -- outbound { toName }, inbound { name }.  Friendship is
--                    mutual or it is nothing: a removal that only took one
--                    side off would leave the other holding a row whose
--                    owner would be asked for consent all over again.
--
-- **Only the answer is checked by the hub, and it has to be.**  A client that
-- could send an answer to anybody could put itself on a stranger's friends
-- list without ever being agreed to, so the hub only passes one on when it is
-- holding a matching ask (see its friend handlers).  The removal needs no such
-- check: the hub stamps the sender's own name on it, so the worst a forged one

-- ------- mediated battles
--
-- Seven types, and they are grouped by feature rather than split across the
-- two direction headings above, because the whole point of them is the
-- *round trip*: an intermediator -- the dedicated hub, or a LAN host -- reads
-- three of these and answers with three others, and reading a choice next to
-- the event it produces is what makes the exchange legible.  Which way each
-- one travels is written beside it.
--
-- What changes here is not the vocabulary but who is trusted with the dice.
-- Everything above this block is relayed: both hubs forward a payload they
-- never read, and the arithmetic of a fight happens on one of the players'
-- clients (LinkBattle's lockstep for 1v1, the host client's CoopSim for 2v2).
-- These seven exist so that it does not: the intermediator owns hit, crit,
-- damage, status and the outcome, and a client sends a choice and draws what
-- it is told.  A modified client can still lie on the sheet it uploads before
-- the fight -- that is the accepted v1 surface -- but it can no longer decide
-- that a move hit, or for how much.
--
-- Nothing in here is ROM-derived and nothing may become so.  The numbers the
-- formulas need arrive from the player's *own* decoded copy, for that match
-- only: BATTLE_RULESET carries the type chart, and each move carries its own
-- power and accuracy on BATTLE_PARTY.  That is why there is no move table on
-- either intermediator, and why there must never be one.

-- The ephemeral rules for one match: { chart, seed }, from whichever client is
-- the authority for it (a LAN host, or the asker on a dedicated hub).  Sent
-- once, before any party, and never stored past the battle.
M.BATTLE_RULESET   = "mmo.battle_ruleset"

-- combatant sends their own -- and for a co-op fight against an NPC, the player
-- who walked into the trainer sends the trainer's too, because they are the
-- only one whose copy of the world has it.
M.BATTLE_PARTY     = "mmo.battle_party"
-- The field is assembled and the first turn is open: { battle, mode, sides }.
-- The one message that starts a mediated fight, and the only one -- a client
-- that has uploaded a party and not seen this has nothing to draw yet.
M.BATTLE_READY     = "mmo.battle_ready"
-- What this player wants to do this turn: { battle, action, slot, move, target,
-- item }.  A choice, never a result: the fields name an intent off a menu, and
-- what it costs is the intermediator's to decide.
M.BATTLE_CHOICE    = "mmo.battle_choice"
-- One thing to draw, in order: { battle, seq, t, ... }.  `seq` is what makes
-- the stream a stream -- a client applies events in that order and can tell a
-- gap from a pause, which is the whole difference between a battle that is
-- thinking and one that has lost messages.
M.BATTLE_EVENT     = "mmo.battle_event"
-- How it ended: { battle, outcome, winners, losers, reason }.
--

-- retired for these fights.
M.BATTLE_OUTCOME   = "mmo.battle_outcome"
-- "I dropped, and I am back": { battle }.  Carries the battle rather than

-- read which fight this is off a socket it has only just met.

-- ------- mediated battles
--
-- The shapes the seven mmo.battle_* types carry.  They are sanitised on the
-- same rule as everything above -- rebuild the table, refuse the half-formed --
-- but the reason bites harder here, and it is worth saying once: these tables
-- are the **inputs to arithmetic**, not fields on a screen.
--
-- A bad name draws wrong and a bad map id places nothing; a bad `accuracy` is a
-- comparison against an RNG roll, and a party length nobody counted is a battle
-- with no last monster in it.  So nothing here is clamped into something
-- plausible and then used -- an out-of-range number is never rounded into range,
-- because the alternative is an intermediator resolving a fight from figures it
-- made up.
--
-- A field that is present and unreadable takes its whole message with it almost
-- everywhere here.  The one exception is BATTLE_EVENT, whose optional fields are
-- dropped instead, and the argument for that is written where it happens.
--
-- Four of these are read by the intermediator (RULESET, PARTY, CHOICE,
-- RECONNECT) and three by clients (READY, EVENT, OUTCOME), and both ends run
-- *this* file or its JS twin in server/lib/sanitize.js.  **The twins have to
-- accept and refuse the same bytes**, which is the tightest constraint in this
-- section: a party the hub took and the client threw away is a fight one end
-- thinks is running, and it fails with both processes behaving correctly.  Every
-- bound below has a named counterpart there -- so a rule added to one, however
-- prudent on its own, is a divergence until it is added to both.

-- The largest value one type-effectiveness cell may hold, as integer percent.
--
-- Percent rather than a float, because this number crosses a JSON boundary into
-- two languages and is then multiplied into a damage figure: 0.5 and 2 survive
-- that trip, but a chart that carried 0.1 would round differently on the two
-- ends and the same attack would do different damage depending on who was

-- and ends.  Mid-fight cheating is what the intermediator removes; the
-- pre-fight sheet stays a client claim because the hub holds no ROM species
-- table and never will (legal floor / no ROM bytes).
--
-- **Bags (PROTOCOL 15).** The party message may carry an optional `bag` — a
-- list of `{id, count}` stacks. The hub stores it under the connection, holds
-- a stack when an `item` choice is accepted, and decrements only when the turn
-- resolves (so `cancel`/`unchose` never needs a refund). Entries must be ids
-- BattleSim knows (`itemEffect`), including vitamins (fight-local Stat Exp;
-- client writebacks `save.statExp` on confirm). Counts and battler sheets
-- remain a **claim**: a modified client can still invent 99 POTION or a god
-- team on upload. That is the accepted bound — mid-fight free heals without a
-- matching stack are what the bag removes. Absent `bag` means empty.

--
-- `slot`, `ivs` and `evs` are optional wholesale but not piecemeal, and an
-- unreadable one refuses the battler rather than being dropped: a snapshot from a
-- client that does not track EVs is fine and common, while a snapshot with two of

-- The shapes a mediated fight comes in.

--   1v1       -- two players, one monster each
--   coop_npc  -- a party of two against a trainer somebody walked into
--   coop_pvp  -- two parties against each other
--   wild      -- one player against one hub NPC seat (catch/run legal;
--               protocol-only; no overworld divert)
--   coop_wild -- two humans vs one wild NPC seat (catch/run legal; overworld
--               divert when partied + same map — seating lands in a later wave)
--
-- Named on the wire rather than inferred from how many ids arrived, because the
-- two co-op modes have the same four field slots and differ only in whether one
-- side has an owner -- and "guess the mode from the roster" is the kind of
-- inference that is right until an NPC battle happens to have a spectatorless
-- second slot.

-- Both sides are required, even in a coop_npc fight where one of them is a
