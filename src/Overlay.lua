-- Nicknames over remote players' heads.
--
-- Names and nothing else.  Chat used to float over a head as a speech bubble
-- and does not any more: what somebody said is a toast in the corner now
-- (src/Toast.lua), where it is legible at any window size and does not
-- depend on the speaker being on screen.  What is left here is the one thing
-- that genuinely belongs in the world -- which of these characters is who.
--
-- This draws from the render.hud hook, which runs after the frame is
-- composited and before touch controls, and receives a window-space
-- viewport (gameX/gameY/gameWidth/gameHeight/scale).  Nameplates use the
-- same Rajdhani face as the corner toasts (src/Toast.lua), drawn in window
-- pixels so the type stays crisp at any letterbox scale.  Town-map portraits
-- still composite in the game's 160x144 space; only their labels follow the
-- toast face.
--
-- Screen position is derived from the same camera rule SpriteRenderer uses:
-- floor(px - camX), floor(py - camY) - 4, with Camera:follow parking the
-- local player at (64, 60).  The live overworld player's px/py is read for
-- the anchor so a label glides with a mid-step avatar instead of snapping
-- to integer cells.
