--
-- NamingScreen draws the line it is typing into as `maxLen` slots of 8px
-- starting at a fixed x=56 (src/ui/NamingScreen.lua) -- a layout sized for
-- the vanilla seven-character name, which ends at 112 on a 160-wide screen
-- and so never had to think about the right edge.
--
-- Every grid this mod opens is longer than seven. An address is 32, which
-- runs the line out to 312: a player typing "192.168.1.20:7788" watches the
-- port -- the half they most need to check -- disappear off the screen, and
-- what is left sits hard against the right side rather than centred. Chat
-- at 16 overflows too, and the 12 of a join code stops exactly on the edge.
--
-- So this mod repaints that one row on its own screens: as many slots as
-- fit between the margins, centred, and -- once what is typed is longer
-- than the window -- the *end* of it, because the characters just entered
-- are the ones being checked. Nothing else on the page moves. The title
-- sits at y=8 and the grid starts at y=48, so the 8px row at y=24 is the

-- arrow `▷` the engine already draws on a chosen row, one glyph, no new art
-- and nothing shifted, so `MIDDLE AGED WOMAN` still starts where every other
-- label starts.
--
-- The mark yields on the row the cursor is actually on: they share a cell,
-- and two triangles stacked in it would read worse than one. What that costs
-- is small -- every *other* special row still carries its mark, so the list
-- still says how many there are and where they are.
--
-- The row geometry is the widget's (src/ui/ListMenu.lua:draw): an 8px cursor
-- column at x=8, labels from x=16, row `n` at y = 8 + n * 16. Copied rather
-- than asked for, because the widget exposes no seam for a per-row
-- decoration -- so if upstream ever moves a row, this moves with it.
--
-- The mark keeps the cursor column even now that the rows carry a portrait

-- ------- showing each character on its own row

-- leaderboard already draw -- Chars.portrait owns the loading and the cache
-- for exactly this reason, so a third caller costs no second copy of a sheet.
--
-- Where it goes is decided by the widget. ListMenu draws every label at a
-- hardcoded x=16 and offers no offset (src/ui/ListMenu.lua:draw), so the only
-- way to open a gutter is to indent the label itself: two spaces are 16px,
-- which is exactly one portrait wide. The art then lands between the cursor
-- column and the name, and the gutter is the same width on every row whether
-- or not there is art to put in it -- a row that lost its picture must not
-- also lose its alignment.
--
-- What that costs is the widest name. From x=16 the row held eighteen glyphs
-- (16 + 18 * 8 = 160, the screen exactly); from x=32 it holds sixteen, and
-- the catalog's longest wearable label is MIDDLE AGED WOMAN at seventeen --
-- the same name the trainer card had to lay out around. It is trimmed to fit
-- rather than drawn past the edge, which is the trade the leaderboard's name
-- column already makes (M.nameRoom), and it is a trade the picture pays for:

-- does not fit beside a name and a score -- "MIDDLE AGED WOMAN" is seventeen
-- glyphs, the whole row on its own -- so the row shows the portrait instead,
-- the same front-facing frame the trainer card uses. That costs the row its
-- height: sixteen pixels of art means six rows on screen where text would
-- have given twelve, so the list scrolls with up and down.
--
-- Nothing here decides who is on the board. The hub sends ten rows already
-- sorted and already filtered to players with points, because it is the only

-- eighteen, with nothing left for air. Packed that tightly the art touched

-- -- ten glyphs of "KRABBYMAN" plus eleven of "PALLET TOWN" is half a

--
-- A friend's row on the PLAYERS list needs to say so, and the right-hand
-- column is already spoken for -- PARTY, BUSY, or where they are -- while
-- being somebody's friend is true at the same time as all three.
--
-- **In front of the nickname, and not in the cursor's own column.**  The
-- cursor column is where markOwnCharacters puts the CHARACTER list's mark,
-- and it is free -- it costs the row no width at all -- so it was tried here
-- first.  It is wrong for *this* list, for a reason that only shows up on a
-- small hub: a mark sharing that cell has to yield on the row the cursor is
-- on, because two triangles in one 8px cell read as a rubbed-out cursor.  The
-- CHARACTER list has 38 rows, so something is always marked.  PLAYERS on a
-- two-player game has **one** row, the cursor opens on it, and the indicator
-- is then never drawn at all -- an indicator that disappears exactly when you
-- look at the row is not one.
--
-- So it goes in the label, and the place name pays a glyph for it.  That is
-- the trade this row already makes: the place spends whatever the nickname
-- leaves (M.placeRoom), and a name one character longer costs it the same
-- glyph today -- PALLET TOWN already draws as PALLET TOW beside any
-- six-character trainer name.  The mark moves that boundary by one; it does
-- not introduce a kind of trimming the row was not already doing.
--
-- `▷` and not `▶`, and not `*`.  The font is extracted from the ROM and has no
-- asterisk at all: Font.draw silently draws nothing for a character it cannot
-- map while Font.width still advances eight pixels, which is a blank column
-- that reads as a layout bug (src/Overlay.lua's party marker has the whole
-- story).  Of the arrows the charmap does carry, the filled one already means
-- "the person I am travelling with" over a head in the world, so the hollow
-- one -- the same shape, one step less emphatic -- is what the weaker standing
-- relationship gets.  On the selected row the two sit side by side as `▶▷`,
-- and that is legible precisely because they differ in fill: what took an
-- unread marker off the CHAT row was a *second filled* cursor, not a hollow
-- mark beside one.  The engine uses this same glyph as its own non-cursor
-- marker (Theme.cursorHollow).
--
-- **Three bytes of UTF-8**, like the party marker, so anything measuring it
-- for the screen has to count glyphs and not bytes -- which is why placeRoom
-- above is handed the label rather than the name.

  -- pushing a code screen over a handshake that was already spending its
  -- ten-second budget. Asking for what a player has been told anyway (an
  -- address and a code, said in one breath) is one straight line, and the
  -- challenge path below survives as what a mistyped code lands on.

  -- ------- the way out of a naming grid
  --
  -- NamingScreen (src/ui/NamingScreen.lua) pops only from confirm(): it
  -- takes no onCancel, and its B is the backspace. That was survivable while
  -- the code screen appeared only over a live handshake; it is not now that
  -- JOIN GAME asks for the address and then the code on the way in. A player
  -- who opens either without the answer to hand was stuck on it, with no way
  -- back to the overworld short of quitting the game.
  --
  -- So B on an empty line leaves. B with nothing to erase is a press that
  -- already does nothing, so no typing is taken away to buy it, and backing
  -- out with B is what every other screen here does -- it is the button
  -- somebody stuck reaches for. What is on the line is the whole test: one
  -- glyph and B is an eraser again, so a mistyped code is fixed where it was
  -- made instead of being read as "gave up" and thrown back to the menu.
  --
  -- `emptyConfirm` reads START and the ED cell the same way. True for the
  -- code grid, where an empty line has never carried an answer: there is
  -- deliberately no `default` there, so confirm() submits the widget's own
  -- "A", which is refused, which puts the grid straight back -- the loop
  -- this fixes. False for the address grid, where an empty line means "the
  -- hub I already have" and START is how that is accepted.
  --
  -- Nothing here touches game.stack. The escape leaves by the widget's own
  -- confirm(), which pops itself and then calls onDone, so answering
  -- somewhere else is only a question of what onDone is; the fabricated name
  -- it passes is ignored.
