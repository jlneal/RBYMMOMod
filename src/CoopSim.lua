-- The 2-on-2 simulation: four battlers, one turn at a time.
--
-- **This is the part Gen1Recomp does not have, and this file is where it is
-- added.** The engine's `BattleState` carries exactly one active battler per
-- side and `TurnOrder.firstMover` compares a pair; neither can be talked into
-- a four-monster field. So the *field* is modelled here -- four slots, an
-- ordering over all of them, a target on every action, and a faint that pulls
-- the next mon out of that trainer's own party -- and everything underneath it
-- is still the engine's.
--
-- What is emphatically **not** reimplemented: damage. Type effectiveness, STAB,
-- the critical-hit shift chain, the badge boosts, burn's attack cut, screens,
-- the 217..255 random factor -- all of it comes from `src/battle/Damage.lua`
-- through the `damage` seam below, so a mon hits for the same number in a
-- co-op battle as it does in a wild one. A second damage formula living in a
-- mod would be a second answer to a question the engine has already answered,
-- and the two would drift on the first ruleset change.
--
-- **Nothing here requires an engine module, or love.** Every engine part
-- arrives through `deps` at construction. That is what lets the suite drive a
-- whole battle -- four slots, faints, switches, a winner -- under plain luajit
-- with hand-built mons, which is the only way the turn order and the target
-- rules get asserted at all.
--
-- The output is a list of **events**, never a mutated screen. One side
-- simulates and the other three replay what it produces (see CoopBattle's
-- header for why it is host-authoritative rather than four-way lockstep), and
-- a replayed battle and a simulated one have to look identical -- which they
-- do, because the events are the only thing either of them draws from.

-- neither is raced on speed.
-- `npcItem` is deliberately not in this set: it is never accepted off the
-- wire. A trainer's item use is decided by the host's own AI, so a client
-- claiming one would be a client acting for a monster it does not own.
M.KINDS = { move = true, switch = true, item = true, run = true }

-- The one action that is **not** a turn action, and so not in the set above.
--
-- A replacement is answered while the field is *stopped*: a monster has
-- fainted, its slot owes an answer, and nothing resolves until it arrives. It
-- travels down the same wire as a move -- there is only one -- so it is a
-- value a client can put in `kind`, which is exactly why it belongs in the
-- vocabulary rather than being a bare string in one caller and an implicit
-- default in another.
--
-- It is deliberately kept out of KINDS rather than added to it. KINDS is what
-- `resolveTurn` dispatches, and a "replace" that reached it would be handed to
-- `runOther`, which has no branch for it -- so the slot would silently do
-- nothing for the turn instead of falling back to a move. Naming it here says
-- what it is without changing what a turn can be.
--
-- The host does not route on it: a replacement is recognised by the field's
-- own `awaiting`, which is host state and cannot be claimed by a message. The

-- file choosing somebody's move for them.
-- Every slot's HP, right now.
--
