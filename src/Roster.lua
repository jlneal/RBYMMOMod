-- movement, and every mmo.move already carries it -- so threading it through
-- the argument that delivers the step keeps the two from ever disagreeing.

-- broadcast a presence saying so, the roster kept the join-time false, and
-- so the INVITE row went on being offered against somebody who could no
-- longer accept it -- and the PARTY column and the map marker never
-- appeared.  Nothing in the headless suite could see it: the hub sent the
-- right message and the client threw the field away.
