-- Co-op battles: the two of you against one trainer, the two of you against
-- the two of them, and (when partied on the same map) the two of you against
-- one wild encounter.
--
-- Three flows live here, and they are less alike than they look.
--
--   * **Against an NPC.**  One partner walks into a trainer, is asked whether
--     to wait or to go in alone. Waiting is allowed even when the partner is
--     on another map: the invite is stored for them and the join confirm pops
--     automatically when they arrive. They can leave wait mode and take the
--     trainer alone at any time. Accept → both fight it together. Decline →
--     the waiter is told, encouraged, and released into a solo 1v1.
--   * **Against a wild.**  Same-map partner online and free → divert into
--     mediated `coop_wild`: host posts COOP_WAIT and covers the engine wild
--     with a wait box (ALONE = withdraw + solo). Partner auto-joins; no
--     WAIT/JOIN invite. Soft-lock: a wait with no join within COOP_ASK_TIMEOUT
--     withdraws and releases into solo wild. Mutual waits arbitrate by
--     lexicographically smaller playerId (their wait wins; see considerOffer).
--   * **Against another party.**  PARTY BATTLE on the ACTIONS menu, and all
--     four have to agree before anything starts.
--
-- **What this module is, precisely: the agreement.**  It decides who is
-- waiting, who may join, what a "no" costs and what it does not, and when the
-- door closes.  It does not *fight* the battle -- src/CoopSim.lua is the
-- four-slot field and src/CoopBattle.lua is the screen -- but it does assemble
-- it: M:begin runs the party exchange that turns four agreements into four
-- battlers, and pushes the result.
--
-- Three rules are worth naming up front, because every awkward-looking branch
-- below is one of them being obeyed rather than an oversight.
--
-- 1. **A decline ends the wait.**  Saying no to an NPC invite tells the
--    waiter (via the hub), clears the offer, and sends them into the solo
--    fight the engine already built under their prompt. The decliner is not
--    dragged into anything -- if they never walked into the trainer, "no" is
--    simply no.
-- 2. **The fight cannot be dodged.**  Once a trainer has been triggered, every
--    exit from every prompt this module raises ends in a battle.  B on the
--    wait/alone choice is BATTLE ALONE, not "never mind"; B while waiting
--    reopens that same choice rather than releasing the player.  The engine
--    has already committed to the encounter by the time we are asked, so a
--    prompt that could be escaped would be a prompt that skipped a trainer.
-- 3. **The door closes when the battle starts, not when it is agreed.**
--    running is set at handoff and refuses every later join, because a fourth
--    monster appearing mid-turn is not a thing the other three agreed to.
--
-- Shaped like Party and Sessions -- a transport, a ui and the other state
-- modules handed in at construction, no engine modules, no love -- which is
-- what lets the suite drive both flows, from both sides, under plain luajit.

-- was suspended in front of the trainer carry on, and do *not* fight it again.
--
-- This is the other half of rule 2, and the half that is easy to miss: the
-- rule is that a triggered trainer is always resolved, not that it is always
-- fought by one player. Dropping the encounter instead of consuming it leaves
-- the map script suspended forever, which is a frozen game.
-- The co-op battle stood in for the engine's, so the engine's battle is told
-- how it went and takes it from there: the defeated-trainer flag, the victory
-- rewards, a whiteout on a wipe, and the script that has been waiting in front
-- of the trainer since before the prompt went up.
--
-- Handing the result back rather than reimplementing any of it is the whole
-- reason the battle object was held instead of discarded.
--
-- One thing *is* translated on the way out: the result string. A co-op battle
-- reports "win"/"loss"/"draw"; the overworld's afterBattle runs the blackout
-- for the string **"lose"** and for nothing else. Handing it "loss" was
-- therefore handing it "not a loss" -- every player who lost a co-op trainer
-- battle walked out of it with a fainted party and no whiteout. See
-- M.blacksOut for the rule, which is the same rule on both paths.
--
-- **A win is never translated, even by a player whose own team was wiped.**
-- That string is not only a blackout switch: Commands.start_battle reads it
-- back as `ctx.lastCheck = (result == "win")`, which is what the map script
-- standing in front of the trainer branches on and what marks them beaten.
-- Calling a won battle a loss to get the ritual would mark the trainer
-- undefeated on this client and beaten on their partner's -- two worlds that
-- disagree about a gym, from one player's fainted party. So the win goes
-- through as a win, the script and the rewards run, and the ritual that player
-- is still owed is run afterwards by M:blackout. The ritual is owed to the
-- player; the defeat flag is owed to the world.

-- again, alone.  See the comment on the unwind in M:startBattle, which

-- adopts the encounter only when it is demonstrably the same fight, and leaves

--

-- outlive its battle: a player who says yes keeps theirs deliberately (see

-- STOP in the same tick is enough -- in which case they fight the trainer
-- alone, that battle finishes itself, and the reference left behind names

--   3. the NPC side, if there is one, has to be built -- and built *once*, by
--      the host, or the four clients would be fighting four different pairs.
--
-- So this opens a short exchange rather than pushing a screen: everyone posts
-- their packed party, the host waits until it has them all, builds the field
-- and broadcasts it, and all four construct the same battle from the same
-- description.  `pending` is what that exchange is kept in.
--
-- The host is the player who was already standing at the fight (the NPC path)

-- fact both sides can derive without asking, which is what stops two clients

-- there is nothing for the curve to say. Inventing one from the trainer's

-- badges, prize money, the defeated flag -- and pays no points. It is worth
