-- 3. Hub: the relay a hosting player runs
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Hub is deliberately socket-free so it can be driven here with fake peers.
-- These are the same behaviours server/hub.test.js pins on the Node side;
-- two implementations of one protocol only stay honest if both are tested.
--
-- This is *not* a seam for pinning MOTD end-to-end: Hub.lua is the embedded
-- in-game hub, which docs/plans/server-live-ops.md #3 deliberately leaves
-- out of this feature entirely (its Wire.WELCOME below carries no `motd`
-- field at all, and never will). The dedicated hub that does send one is
-- server/lib/relay.js, out of this suite's reach. And src/Client.lua's own
-- welcome handler -- the code that calls `Wire.text(msg.motd,
-- Config.MOTD_MAX)` and pushes the HUB chat line -- lives inside the
-- closure M.install() builds, reachable only by handing it a full mod
-- facade (events, hooks, ui, world, transport, ...); section 1 above loads
-- that closure through the real loader but never connects it, and section
-- 2's `need()` resolver returns the module table without ever calling
-- install(). Driving a real WELCOME through that handler would mean
-- building install()'s whole facade from scratch here -- exactly the heavy
-- scaffolding this suite avoids -- so the welcome-carries-motd behaviour is
-- pinned one layer down instead: Config.MOTD_MAX / Wire.text(_, MOTD_MAX)
-- above (the sanitiser the handler calls) and the Chat push shape above
-- that (the exact table the handler builds from the result).

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------

--
-- The arithmetic is pinned against numbers written out by hand, because
-- server/lib/rank.js has to produce the same ones -- a win worth 27 points
-- on a dedicated hub and 16 on a hosted game is not a ranking, it is two,
-- and the only way that stays true is if both suites assert the same table.
--
-- The hub half is the anti-cheat: a result is a claim by a stranger's
-- process, and the whole defence is that two independent claims have to
-- agree. Every way of getting points without winning a battle is tried here.

-- always loses a draw-order tie against the player: a whole-pixel py is
-- nudged up by AVATAR_DEPTH_NUDGE right after NPC:update recomputes it, and
-- both ways a position leaves the avatar layer -- pose, for the renderer,
-- and cellOf, for a caller comparing against the roster -- add it back so
-- nothing downstream of the sort ever sees the fraction.  See
-- src/Config.lua's AVATAR_DEPTH_NUDGE and src/Avatars.lua's decorate for the
-- full argument.
--
-- A stub class stands in for the engine's NPC: update writes a new
-- whole-pixel py only while moving -- exactly like NPC:update landing a
-- step -- and pose reads py back out seven values wide, the same shape
-- src/Avatars.lua wraps.  cellOf itself reaches through mod.world:npc, a
-- live overworld handle this headless suite does not stand up -- that call
-- is e2e territory, exercised by run-mmo-e2e.sh.  What is pinned here

-- looking at a battle that is not the one being played. Every fault this
-- feature has had at the protocol level has been a violation of exactly this,
-- and each one survived because nothing asserted it: HP that never moved for
-- an attack, a replacement the host filed as a turn, a snapshot that rewound
-- the wrong client.
--
-- Two things make this a real test rather than a restatement of the code:
--
--   1. **The replayer is the real one.** `CoopBattle.playEvents` is called
--      through the metatable on a stand-in carrying only the fields it reads,
--      so this exercises the path a client actually runs. A hand-written copy
--      of "what a replayer does" would agree with itself forever while the
--      shipped code drifted out from under it.
--   2. **The comparison is the one the wire makes.** `signature()`, slot for
--      slot, exactly as CoopBattle compares the host's stamp against its own.
--
-- Checked after *every* turn, never only at the end: a divergence that is
-- corrected by a later event still means somebody watched a wrong number.

-- on a dial that only timed out or was refused. `dialled` and the handler
-- table are both private to that module, reachable only through the real
-- per-tick pump, so this drives a whole, fresh, isolated Client instance
-- through it: a fake Net stands in for the socket (the same shape the
-- Transport section above uses), and `mod.hooks:wrap` is a stub that
-- actually *records* what it is given -- which is what makes the captured
-- "input.step" callback callable directly, exactly the way the real engine
-- calls it once a fixed step.
--
-- Built against a mod facade of its own (resolver(miniMod), not the shared
-- stubMod) so nothing here has to fight the rest of this file over
-- `mod.hooks` / `mod.exports`, which no other section needs to be anything
-- but a no-op. love is removed for the same reason section 13 removes it:
-- the servers store this Client owns would otherwise dual-write through
-- the ambient love stub's real filesystem, which is a second thing to
-- reason about that this section does not need.
