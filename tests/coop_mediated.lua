-- A 2-on-2 refereed by the intermediator, driven with no hub and no display.
--
-- src/CoopBattle.lua is hub-refereed for coop_pvp / coop_npc (always). CoopSim
-- still holds the field the screen draws from; the intermediator decides.
-- What this suite pins is mostly about that seam:
--
--   * the uploads a co-op battle owes before it can be refereed, including the
--     trainer's party the host sends for the npc seat -- and that a *real* hub
--     accepts them and answers mmo.battle_ready;
--   * that the host stops rolling the moment it does. This is the assertion
--     worth having: two fields resolving the same turn is not a fallback, it is
--     a desync, and it would be invisible in play until the two disagreed;
--   * that a choice goes out as mmo.battle_choice and no `act` goes out beside
--     it, because a second unrefereed opinion about a turn is the same bug seen
--     on the wire;
--   * that the event stream reaches the same screen the client-simulated path
--     draws on -- HP, faints, send-outs and the result -- rather than a second
--     renderer built beside it;
--   * and that Config.MEDIATED_COOP is not a runtime off-switch.

-- Run: luajit mods/rby_mmo/tests/coop_mediated.lua
