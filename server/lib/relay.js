/*
 * The hub, as pure logic.
 *
 * This is what server/hub.js used to be, minus the socket. It owns who is
 * connected, where they last said they were, and which two players are
 * currently paired for a trade or a battle.
 *
 * It simulates exactly one thing, and only since PROTOCOL 10: a **mediated
 * battle**. A trade is still the engine's own state machine running inside
 * the two clients with mmo.relay payloads passing through unread, but a fight
 * this hub brokered is resolved here -- see the "mediated battles" section
 * below -- because a battle decided by one of the two players is a battle
 * decided by whichever of them modified their copy first. Every roll, the
 * turn order and the sole win/loss verdict live in lib/battle/Turn.js; this
 * file owns the plumbing around it: who is in which fight, whose party is
 * still missing, and where the events go.
 *
 * **No sockets appear anywhere below.** Everything talks to *peer handles*
 * -- any object answering send(msg), close() and carrying a remoteAddress
 * string. lib/server.js supplies socket-backed ones; a suite supplies
 * fakes. That is the same split src/Hub.lua uses on the Lua side, and it
 * is what lets the cap, the scope routing and the session pairing be
 * tested without binding a port.
 *
 * Authentication is a *port*, not an implementation: `auth` is either null
 * (anyone may join, which is what a LAN game wants) or an object with
 * newNonce() and verify(nonce, response). The relay knows the shape of the
 * handshake and nothing about the cryptography behind it.
 *
 * Everything arriving here is untrusted -- it comes from another player's
 * process, and a modified one is a normal thing to meet -- so every field
 * is re-derived through lib/sanitize before it is believed.

// The wire dialect this hub speaks, and the one number both suites greet
// with. 3 is where parties landed: nothing was removed, but an invite or a
// party chat line sent to a protocol-2 hub would meet a handler table that
// answers an unknown type with silence, and a player pressing INVITE and
// watching nothing happen is a worse sentence than a refusal that names both
// versions. 4 is ranked PVP, and moved for the same reason rather than a
// different one -- a protocol-3 hub has never heard of a battle result or a
// leaderboard request, so a newer client would report every match into
// silence. 5 was claimed twice, by two branches that had never met -- once
// for pace (the `fast` flag on mmo.move, which a protocol-4 hub's fixed
// field list drops without a word) and once for co-op battles (a protocol-4
// hub has never heard of mmo.coop_wait, so a player would press WAIT FOR
// <friend> while their partner is never told). Each 5 was a different
// vocabulary, so a client and hub that both said "5" could still be talking
// past each other. 6 is the first number that means both. And then 6 was
// claimed twice the same way, before it ever shipped: once by that union and
// once for the character a player is wearing -- settled at hello and never
// again until mmo.sprite, a type a hub that predates it answers with
// silence, so the player who picked somebody new would be the only one in
// the game who ever saw it. 7 is the first number that means all of it. 8 is
// mmo.party_event -- what the person a player is travelling with just did,
// fanned out from here to the party and to nobody else -- and a protocol-7 hub
// has never heard the type, so a player would watch their partner fight all
// evening and never be told a thing, which neither end can tell apart from an
// ordinary quiet route. 9 is mmo.request_cancel -- the asker withdrawing a
// trade/battle request before it is answered -- and a protocol-8 hub would
// clear the asker's local wait while still holding pendingTo, so the other
// player could accept into a session the asker thought they had left. 10 is the
// mediated battle -- mmo.battle_ruleset, _party, _ready, _choice, _event,
// _outcome and _reconnect, the seven types a fight uses once an intermediator
// owns the simulation rather than one of the two clients -- and it is the
// clearest bump of the list: a protocol-9 hub has never heard any of them, so a
// client would upload its party and its choices into silence and sit at a
// battle screen that never opens, while the hub it is talking to is still
// waiting for the two-client mmo.result vote that this path replaces. 11 is the
// mediated battle event `chose` -- a seat filed this turn's answer, so peers
// can keep the wait line accurate without an `act` fan-out -- and `unchose`,
// which clears that mark when a player cancels a choice they already submitted.
// A protocol-10 intermediator never emits either kind, so a newer client's
// wait line would name players who have already answered, or keep naming players
// who walked their answer back, and neither failure looks like lag -- both read
// as "still choosing". 12 adds `moves` for mid-fight move-list sync after
// Transform or Mimic. 13–15 extend ruleset / fight surface / bag proofs; 16 is
// persistent playerId seating (claim tickets gone). 17 is friends --
// mmo.friend_ask, mmo.friend_answer and mmo.friend_remove -- which landed as
// PROTOCOL 10 on the parallel main line while this branch claimed 10–16 for
// mediation; a protocol-16 intermediator answers all three with silence, and
// this is the one feature whose answer may legitimately arrive later (the hub
// holds an ask for a player who is offline), so "nothing has happened yet" is
// an ordinary state and a player would have no way at all to tell it from a
// hub that cannot do this. 18 is Party vs Wild: mode token `coop_wild` (two
// humans vs one wild NPC seat) and an optional `catcher` player id on
// mmo.battle_outcome so a successful ball names who keeps the mon. A
// protocol-17 hub's closed BATTLE_MODES set drops `coop_wild` opens, and its
// outcome cleaner strips an unknown `catcher` -- either way the partner never
// joins the grass fight, or both clients grant (or neither) because ownership
// was never named. The rule every bump follows is unchanged: bump whenever a
// client can send something a hub silently ignores. Kept in step with
// Config.PROTOCOL on the mod side. 19 adds host-owned co-op gameplay policy;
// a protocol-18 client would ignore disabled rewards or automatic-join policy.
// 20 makes Party vs Wild live before a second player joins and adds packed-
// field plus authoritative-history hydration; a protocol-19 client would wait
// forever under the old fixed-roster COOP_JOINED meaning.
// 21 adds Campaign State frontier and sequence authority. A protocol-20 hub
// would silently discard those requests, so the combined integration must not
// claim wire compatibility with the standalone flexible-Wild branch.
// 22 adds campaignCatcher, the stable admitted actor corresponding to the
// authoritative singular catcher. A protocol-21 client silently strips it and
// cannot attach the personal capture consequence safely.
// 23 adds bounded same-world closed-prefix hydration packages.
// 24 adds acknowledged one-at-a-time frames for larger prefix packages.
// 25 adds the bounded display-only follower convoy carried with presence.
// A protocol-24 observer would silently omit it, so mixed builds are refused.
// 26 adds session-scoped, revisioned field populations. A protocol-25 hub

 * cannot live here), so nothing below records who is friends with whom -- it

 * definition, no connection left to hang on. keyOf is the fold, the same one
 * the rank board uses, so "the same name" means one thing on this hub.
 *
 * Three handlers, and the asymmetry between them is the security model. The
 * ask is forwarded on the sender's say-so, because the worst it can do is put
 * a yes/no box in front of somebody who says no. The *answer* is not: a client
 * that could send one to anybody would be a client that adds itself to a
 * stranger's list without ever being agreed to, so it is only passed on when
 * this hub is holding the matching ask. The removal needs no check at all,
 * because the hub stamps the sender's own name on it -- the only thing a
 * forged one achieves is taking its sender off somebody's list, which is what
