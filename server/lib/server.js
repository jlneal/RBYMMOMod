/*
 * The socket layer, and only the socket layer.
 *
 * Everything that decides *anything* already lives somewhere else: the
 * protocol in lib/relay.js, the hardening in lib/limits.js, the crypto in
 * lib/auth.js, the file in lib/config.js, the operator's socket in
 * lib/admin.js. This module owns the one thing none of them may touch -- the
 * listener friends actually play through -- and hands them the bytes.
 *
 * The operator's listener is started from here and owned there, and that
 * split is the point: it may not be a reason the game port fails to come up.
 * The game listener binds first because it is why the process exists; the
 * admin socket is attempted after it, and a failure there is a logged
 * sentence and a hub that keeps relaying.
 *
 * Keeping the split that strict is what makes the hub testable at all. The
 * relay is driven by peer handles, so a suite can pair two of them in memory
 * and never bind a port; the limits are pure bookkeeping over an injected
 * clock, so an hour of idleness costs a test nothing. Reintroducing a policy
 * decision down here would quietly move it back out of reach of both.
 *
 * Three behaviours below are deliberate and easy to mistake for oversights:
 *
 *  - **A seat is charged at hello, not at accept** (plan §3.6). Ungreeted
 *    sockets are bounded by limits.maxPending and reaped by
 *    limits.handshakeTimeoutMs instead, so four silent sockets can no longer
 *    lock everyone out of a four-player hub the way hub.js:369 allowed. The
 *    one courtesy exception is spelled out at its call site.
 *  - **Registered sockets carry no timers of their own**, only the ~1 s
 *    sweep. Per-socket timers were how the old hub conflated "has not
 *    finished its handshake" with "has said nothing for a while", which are
 *    different failures with different budgets. The two exceptions are
 *    sockets nobody is keeping -- the one-second forced-close budget on
 *    shutdown, and the quarter-second a refusal gets to reach the wire --
 *    where there is exactly one budget and nothing to conflate it with.
 *  - **A rejected connection is destroyed without a reply when the rejection
 *    is a flood signal**, and answered in one sentence when it is not. Bytes
 *    spent on a flooder are the attack; bytes spent on an honest friend
 *    behind the same NAT are the whole point of having a message at all.
 *  - **The authentication throttle is asked before a nonce is minted, and
 *    told only about genuine credential rejections.** Both halves matter: a
 *    refusal that got recorded as a failure would let an honest player extend
 *    their own backoff by retrying, and a check that ran after the challenge
 *    was sent would not be a throttle at all. What a tripped hub-wide ceiling
 *    must *not* do is touch anybody already playing; see the call site.
 *
 * No dependencies: node:net plus this directory.

   * practice it meant the change did not happen at all.

   * needed a restart to change would announce it to nobody.
   *

   * inferred.
