 * ---------------------------------------------------------- mediated battles
 *
 * PROTOCOL 10's vocabulary: the seven types a fight uses once an
 * *intermediator* -- this hub, or a LAN game's host process -- owns the
 * simulation instead of one of the two clients.
 *
 *   mmo.battle_ruleset    host client -> intermediator. The type chart and the
 *                         global constants this one match runs under, uploaded
 *                         once. Ephemeral on purpose: nothing ROM-derived is
 *                         stored, and a modded chart is a thing two players
 *                         may agree on without either of them shipping it.
 *   mmo.battle_party      each combatant -> intermediator. The sheet they are
 *                         fighting with: stats, moves and the fields needed to
 *                         resolve them, status, HP, level, IVs and EVs.
 *   mmo.battle_ready      intermediator -> clients. The field is confirmed and
 *                         the first turn is open.
 *   mmo.battle_choice     client -> intermediator. One turn's action.
 *   mmo.battle_event      intermediator -> clients. The ordered stream a
 *                         client draws; `seq` is what makes it ordered.
 *   mmo.battle_outcome    intermediator -> clients. The *sole* result, which
 *                         is the whole point: it replaces the two-client
 *                         mmo.result vote for these fights.
 *   mmo.battle_reconnect  client -> intermediator. Rejoin inside the grace.
 *
 * Everything below is the Node half of the matching sanitisers in
 * src/Wire.lua, and the reason for that mirror is the one at the top of this
 * file, sharpened: a battle is now *decided* by whichever intermediator
 * happens to own it, so a field one of the two accepts and the other refuses
 * is not a cosmetic difference -- it is the same sheet producing a fight on
 * one hosting path and a refusal on the other.
 *
 * Two rules run through the lot:
 *
 *  - **A sheet is bounded, not believed.** Every ceiling here exists so that one
 *    client cannot make the process the weapon -- a 400-row type chart, a party
 *    of two hundred -- not so that it cannot cheat. Inflated sheets are a known,
 *    accepted v1 cost (see the README); what sanitising buys is coherence, so
 *    that every fight resolves and ends.
 *  - **Bounds and shapes are mirrored; judgement is not invented.** Where
 *    Wire.lua refuses a whole message this refuses the whole message, where it
 *    drops a field this drops the field, and where it declines to check something
 *    -- a chart's squareness, a cell against EFF_MULTS -- so does this. A rule
 *    that exists in only one of the two sanitisers is not caution, it is the
 *    divergence above wearing a helpful face: a sheet this hub refuses and a LAN
 *    host fights.
 *
 * The line that split between drop and refuse is worth holding on to, because it
 * is not uniform: a *message* whose optional field is present and unreadable is
 * refused whole (a party's `side`, a mon's `ivs`, a ruleset's `seed`), while an
 * **event** drops any optional field of its own -- see cleanBattleEvent for why a
 * hole in an ordered stream is worse than a blank in a sentence.
 */

/*
 * The type chart's ceilings, and the scale its cells are written on.
 *
 * Integer percent rather than a float, because this number crosses a JSON
 * boundary into two languages and is then multiplied into a damage figure: 0.5

 * the two ends and the same attack would do different damage depending on who
 * was hosting.
 *
 * EFF_MULTS names the six multipliers a Gen 1 chart is built out of and is
 * deliberately **not** a gate, matching Wire.lua's chartOf, which bounds a cell
 * and does not check membership. The reason is the legal posture rather than
 * laziness: the chart arrives from a player's own decoded data, a pack may
 * legitimately rebalance a matchup to 75, and refusing it would drop a coherent
 * modded ruleset in the name of catching a malformed one. Gen 1's own cells only
 * ever hold 0, 50, 100 or 200 -- the quarter and the quadruple come out of
 * composing two of them against a dual type, in the sim, not out of the chart.
 * It is exported for the sim and the fixtures to read, not to enforce here.

 * number is a number, in a range the formulas survive, and the fight resolves
 * and ends. Mid-fight cheating is what the intermediator removes; the
 * pre-fight sheet stays a client claim because the hub holds no ROM species
 * table and never will (legal floor / no ROM bytes).
 *
 * **Bags (PROTOCOL 15).** Optional `bag` on the party message. The hub holds a
 * stack on `item` choice accept and decrements only when the turn resolves, so
 * cancel/unchose never needs a refund. Entries must be BattleSim-known
 * (`itemEffect`), including vitamins (fight-local Stat Exp; client writebacks
 * save.statExp). Counts and battler sheets remain a claim (inventing 99
 * POTION or a god team on upload is the accepted bound). Absent `bag`
 * means empty.
 *
 * `species` is prose rather than an id, and gets NAME_MAX like
 * Wire.partyEvent's, because what it is for is the name in "PIKACHU used ...",
 * drawn on somebody else's screen. An intermediator holds no species table to
 * look one up in (it has no ROM data and never will), so anything that needs an
 * id-shaped species has to carry its own field rather than reusing this one.
 *
 * `hp` above `maxHp` is refused even though both are individually in range,
 * because it is the one incoherence that reaches arithmetic rather than a screen:
 * the HP bar and several formulas divide by maxHp, and a battler at 300/100 draws
 * a bar past its own box and starts the fight already impossible to describe.
 * `maxHp` therefore starts at 1 while `hp` starts at 0 -- a fainted monster is
 * ordinary, a monster with no capacity is not.
 *
 * `status`, `ivs`, `evs` and `slot` are optional wholesale but not piecemeal, and
 * a present-but-unreadable one refuses the battler: a snapshot from a client that
 * tracks no IVs is fine and common, while a snapshot with two of the four is a bug
 * on the sending side that accepting would silently zero the rest of.
